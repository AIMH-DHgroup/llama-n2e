Many monsters appear in old sea stories, including the Aspidochelone (or Fastitocalon), a creature similar to an island; the bishop-fish (also known as the sea bishop, sea monk or monk-fish); and the biblical Leviathan.\n2. Greek philosopher Aristotle (fourth century BC) distinguished the common squid (teuthis) from its larger and rarer cousin (teuthus or, in some translations, teuthos), which could reach 2.3m in length.\n3. Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (first century AD) described a giant squid, which had a body “as large as a barrel” and tentacles reaching 9.1m in length.\n4. In Pliny's works, the giant squid was treated as a common animal and did not belong to myths of his age.\n5. However, some later authors, especially in fictional literature, made the mistake of considering the Kraken a sea monster.\n6. The legend of the Kraken was born from sailors' accounts dating back to a millennium after Pliny's time.\n7. The Kraken was described as colossal in size, as large as an island, and capable of sinking ships; it haunted the seas between Norway and Iceland, and between Iceland and Greenland.\n8. Two Nordic sea monsters with records almost as old as the Kraken appear in the \"Saga of Örvar-Oddr\" (an Icelandic story from the thirteenth century by an anonymous author); their names are Hafgufa (“sea-mist”) and Lyngbakr (“heather-back”).\n9. These monsters shared many features with the Kraken, namely their gigantic size (as big as an island or mountain) and their inclination to attack ships and their crews.\n10. Sea serpents, reptile-like (sometimes even dragon-like) beasts capable of sinking ships and devouring their crews, are described in numerous seamen's reports and scientific literature.\n11. According to Ellis (2004), most of these sea serpent reports can be reduced to encounters with giant squids.\n12. The oldest certified record of a giant squid (rediscovered by Norwegian naturalist Japetus Steenstrup in 1849) is found in Thingøre Sand, Iceland, in 1639.\n13. Whalers began to realize that the sperm whales they hunted regurgitated fragments of huge arms when killed, and sailors did not take long to relate these pieces to the Kraken.\n14. Linnaeus (1735) included the Kraken in his \"Systema naturae,\" where he classified all known organisms. He used the classification \"Microcosmus marinus\" for the Kraken, stating that it was a “singular monster” that inhabited the Norwegian seas.\n15. In another work, \"Fauna Svecica,\" Linnaeus (1746) also used the classification \"Microcosmus marinus\" for the Kraken, but later regretted describing an imaginary beast in his scientific works and removed the Kraken from further editions of \"Systema naturae.\"\n16. After this event, everyone (naturalists or not) adopted once and for all the image of a giant squid for the Kraken; i.e., Linnaeus’s “formal” description marked the point when the mysterious monster took on its modern cephalopod form.\n17. Bishop Erik Pontoppidan describes the Kraken as the world’s largest animal (a circumference of 2.5 km) in his work, \"The natural history of Norway\" (1752; 1752-1753).",

The Kraken was incorporated into Nordic mythology and folklore, with an ancient manuscript from circa 1180 describing it as just one of many sea monsters.\n5.

Bishop Erik Pontoppidan describes the Kraken as the world's largest animal (a circumference of 2.5 km) in his work \"The natural history of Norway.\"\n12. Pontoppidan reports that the Kraken, when rising from the sea, could easily be mistaken for a mountain; its colossal size made it more similar to an island than to an organized being."

The Royal Air Force (RAF) stood as the last line of defense against Hitler's Luftwaffe, whose relentless bombing raids threatened to break the spirit of the British people.\n\nAmong the brave RAF pilots was Flight Lieutenant James Montgomery, known affectionately as \"Monty\" among his comrades. Tall and lean with a square jaw and piercing blue eyes, Monty possessed a calm demeanor that belied his fierce determination in the cockpit of his Spitfire.\n\nOne fateful day, as the sun hung low on the horizon, Monty and his squadron scrambled to intercept a large formation of German bombers escorted by swarms of Messerschmitt fighters. The sky became a swirling canvas of smoke and fire as dogfights erupted in every direction.\n\nMonty's squadron engaged the enemy with ferocity, weaving through the clouds and diving towards the Luftwaffe formations with deadly intent. But amidst the chaos of aerial combat, disaster struck as Flight Officer Carter, a young pilot under Monty's command, found himself targeted by a group of enemy fighters.\n\nMonty watched in horror as Carter's Spitfire took a barrage of hits, smoke billowing from its engines as it began to spiral out of control. Without hesitation, Monty broke formation and dove towards Carter's stricken plane, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\nAs he closed in on Carter's aircraft, Monty could see the young pilot struggling to maintain control, his cockpit engulfed in flames. With nerves of steel, Monty maneuvered his Spitfire underneath Carter's faltering plane, positioning himself to offer assistance.\n\n\"Come on, Carter, bail out!\" Monty shouted over the radio, his voice tinged with urgency.\n\nBut Carter, disoriented and panic-stricken, hesitated, his hands trembling on the controls.\n\n\"We can't hold much longer, Carter! You've got to jump!\" Monty urged, his eyes scanning the sky for any sign of enemy fighters closing in.\n\nWith a final desperate nod, Carter ejected from his stricken aircraft, his parachute blossoming open just seconds before his Spitfire plunged earthward in a fiery explosion.\n\nMonty watched the scene unfold with a mixture of relief and sorrow, his heart heavy with the knowledge that not every pilot would be as fortunate as Carter. But there was no time to dwell on the loss as he found himself suddenly surrounded by a swarm of enemy fighters, their guns blazing with deadly intent.\n\nDrawing on years of training and instinct honed in countless hours of aerial combat, Monty fought with unparalleled skill and determination, his Spitfire dancing through the sky with grace and precision. He barrel-rolled and looped, using every trick in the book to evade the enemy's fire and gain the upper hand.\n\nBut the odds were against him, and for every enemy fighter he downed, two more seemed to take its place. Monty knew he couldn't keep this up much longer; his fuel was running low, and his ammunition was nearly spent.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Monty made the decision to break off the engagement and make a run for it, hoping to lead the enemy away from the vulnerable civilian targets below. With a burst of speed, he dove towards the cloud cover, his pursuers hot on his tail.\n\nFor what felt like an eternity, Monty flew on, the roar of enemy engines growing fainter behind him. And then, just when he thought he couldn't hold out any longer, he burst through the clouds and saw the familiar coastline of England stretching out before him.\n\nWith a whoop of triumph, Monty pushed his throttle to the limit and raced for home, his heart soaring with relief at having cheated death once again. As he touched down on the runway and taxied his Spitfire back to the hangar, he knew that he had been part of something truly extraordinary, a battle that would be remembered for generations to come as a testament to the courage and resilience of the human spirit.\n\nAnd though the scars of war would never fully heal, Monty knew that as long as there were men and women like him willing to stand up and fight for what was right, the light of freedom would never be extinguished."

Leonardo Bruni (Arezzo, 1370 - Florence, March 9, 1444) recounts his journey to Constance in a letter from his private epistolary addressed to his friend Niccolò Niccoli.\n2. Bruni, who held the post of apostolic secretary on behalf of Pope John XXIII, headed to the German city along with the entourage of curials in the pontiff's service to attend the work of the Council.\n3. In order to reach Pope John XXIII, who made his entrance in Constance as early as October 28, Bruni had to move from Rome with the other members of the Curia a few weeks later.\n4. Bruni arrived in Verona on November 27 and stayed there for two days, during which he had the opportunity to admire some of the city’s principal beauties.\n5. Bruni begins the journey to Constance by following the lower course of the Adige River until he reaches the foothills of the Alps, where he pauses to admire the exact point where the river, coming out of the plain, creeps between the mountains.\n6. Bruni describes in particular the narrow valleys and passages of the river between the steep mountain walls on his right, while on the left the landscape is even more impervious, with eddies of water meandering between high cliffs and sharp rocks silhouetted against the sky.\n7. Bruni arrives in the city of Trento, of which he appreciates the urbanitas and the happy geographical location, set in a wide valley where the Adige River becomes more placid, in contrast to the harshness of the places just outside the center and the incivility of the people who live there.\n8. It is not only the geographical element that attracts Bruni’s attention: walking through the streets of the city and meeting the locals, the humanist is immediately struck by the bilingual speech of the inhabitants, since \"viri mulieresque et cetera multitudo intra una moenia constituti alii Italico, alii Germanico sermone utuntur\".\n9. This particular condition is due - Bruni knows this well and makes it explicit - precisely to the geographical position of the region, squeezed between Italian and German territories.\n10. Of this pulcherrimus village located east of the Adige River and west of Mount Roen (\"in sinistro montem trans amnem positum\"), Bruni is immediately struck by the great winemaking tradition that still constitutes the distinctive feature of the municipality and the entire area.\n11. When observing the expanses of vines that characterize the area, Bruni notices the clear, almost snowy color of the soil that still gives rise to the delicious white wine of Tramin, a product of excellence renowned throughout the world.\n12. The group arrives at the vast plateau of the Reschen Pass in the Vinschgau, which contains two lakes of modest size.\n13. Bruni points out that from each of them, \"parvo inter se spatio distantes,\" two \"aquarum divortia\" divide: from the southernmost lake, that is San Valentino alla Muta, flows the Adige, while from the one \"qui Germaniam versus aspicit,\" that is, the northernmost Resia Lake, flows a tributary of the Danube, the Inn River.\n14. Bruni, though meticulous in his observational and descriptive skills, commits an inaccuracy, since, while in fact the Adige River has its source in Lake Resia and is then diverted into Lake Muta, the Inn has its source in Lake Lunghin, located to the southwest in the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland.\n15. Bruni, however, still had to cross the course of the Inn on his way up the river eastward along the Swiss-Italian border.\n16. To cross the pass and begin the descent, Bruni and his traveling companions crossed a forested and impassable valley, which the humanist describes in the letter by citing the different varieties of trees he had been able to recognize along the way: scots pines, cypresses, ash trees, beech trees, and hornbeams.\n17. The group of travelers reaches the Arlberg Pass, at 1793 meters above sea level.\n18. At this point the route, three thousand steps long (about 2 km), becomes extremely difficult, as Bruni writes in the letter, \"Huius montis transitus longe difficillimus, atque asperrimus fuit\", because of the steep terrain and the high and still fresh snow.\n19. This, however, does not prevent Bruni from observing the beauty of the surrounding nature, so rugged and untouched, with a mixture of awe and fear.\n20. After about fifteen kilometers, the group can finally leave the Alps and the Arlberg mount behind, and makes its entrance into Valcircium, today Feldkirch, \"oppidum [...] opulentum atque urbanum\" where it stops to spend the night.\n21. The town appears to Bruni to be very pleasant and well-kept, rich in vineyards and orchards: \"aedificia habet speciosa, vinetis et pometis plurimum abundat\".",
                "1": "\n1. Leonardo Bruni (Arezzo, 1370 - Florence, March 9, 1444) recounts his journey to Constance in a letter from his private epistolary addressed to his friend Niccolò Niccoli.\n2. Bruni, who held the post of apostolic secretary on behalf of Pope John XXIII, headed to the German city along with the entourage of curials in the pontiff's service to attend the work of the Council.\n3. In order to reach Pope John XXIII, who made his entrance in Constance as early as October 28, Bruni had to move from Rome with the other members of the Curia a few weeks later.\n4. Bruni arrived in Verona on November 27 and stayed there for two days, during which he had the opportunity to admire some of the city’s principal beauties.\n5. Bruni begins the journey to Constance by following the lower course of the Adige River until he reaches the foothills of the Alps, where he pauses to admire the exact point where the river, coming out of the plain, creeps between the mountains.\n6. Bruni describes in particular the narrow valleys and passages of the river between the steep mountain walls on his right, while on the left the landscape is even more impervious, with eddies of water meandering between high cliffs and sharp rocks silhouetted against the sky.\n7. Bruni arrives in the city of Trento, of which he appreciates the urbanitas and the happy geographical location, set in a wide valley where the Adige River becomes more placid, in contrast to the harshness of the places just outside the center and the incivility of the people who live there.\n8. It is not only the geographical element that attracts Bruni’s attention: walking through the streets of the city and meeting the locals, the humanist is immediately struck by the bilingual speech of the inhabitants, since \"viri mulieresque et cetera multitudo intra una moenia constituti alii Italico, alii Germanico sermone utuntur\".\n9. Bruni's transalpine journey to Constance coincides for an initial stretch with part of the ancient Via Claudia Augusta, the route built in the first century by Emperor Augustus to connect the territories of the empire with the new annexations of Rhaetia and Vindelicia.\n10. Bruni arrives in Merano, the suburb appears to be without walls and so small in extent that the humanist is uncertain whether to call it oppidum or vicus.\n11. The center, however, precisely in the 13th-14th centuries experienced the start of a rich phase of economic and urban development, which is evidently perceived by Bruni when he writes that \"Omnia quippe sunt ad urbis sufficientiam\" and that both Termeno and Marano are \"opulentissimis locis\".\n12. The group arrives at the vast plateau of the Reschen Pass in the Vinschgau, which contains two lakes of modest size.\n13. Bruni points out that from each of them, \"parvo inter se spatio distantes,\" two \"aquarum divortia\" divide: from the southernmost lake, that is San Valentino alla Muta, flows the Adige, while from the one \"qui Germaniam versus aspicit,\" that is, the northernmost Resia Lake, flows a tributary of the Danube, the Inn River.\n14. Bruni describes the origin of the river, which springs from the Alps not far from their location, and the characteristics of the riverbed, with its sinuous and rapidus course.\n15. After about fifteen kilometers, the group can finally leave the Alps and the Arlberg mount behind, and makes its entrance into Valcircium, today Feldkirch, \"oppidum [...] opulentum atque urbanum\" where it stops to spend the night."

                "0": "\n1. Many monsters appear in old sea stories.\n2. Among the others, the Aspidochelone (or Fastitocalon), a creature similar to an island; the bishop-fish (also known as the sea bishop, sea monk or monk-fish), a sea monster whose legend might also have originated from encounters with seals, sharks or walruses; and, even the biblical Leviathan.\n3. Myth around these creatures has lived at least up to mid 1800 and is still alive in some cultures.\n4. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (fourth century BC), in his work \"The history of animals\", distinguished the common squid (teuthis) from its larger and rarer cousin (teuthus or, in some translations, teuthos), which could reach 2.3m in length.\n5. Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (first century AD), in his work \"Natural history\", described a giant squid, which had a body “as large as a barrel” and tentacles reaching 9.1m in length.\n6. Curiously, In Pliny’s (as well as in Aristotle’s) works, the giant squid was treated as a common animal and did not belong to myths of their ages.\n7. However, some later authors, especially in fictional literature, made thismistake.\n8. In fact, the Kraken’s legend originated from sailors’ accounts dating from a millennium after the age of Pliny.\n9. The legend of the Kraken was born from seamen’s stories, but it was much modified and strengthened over the years.\n10. Right from the start, the Kraken was universally incorporated into Nordic mythology and folklore.\n11. According to an obscure, ancient manuscript of circa 1180 by King Sverre of Norway, the Kraken was just one of many sea monsters.\n12. Still, it had its own peculiarities: it was colossal in size, as large as an island, and capable of sinking ships; it haunted the seas between Norway and Iceland, and between Iceland and Greenland.\n13. Two Nordic sea monsters have records almost as old as the Kraken, appearing in the “Saga of Örvar-Oddr” (an Icelandic story from the thirteenth century by an anonymous author); their names are Hafgufa (“sea-mist”) and Lyngbakr (“heather-back”).\n14. The habits of theses monsters were later described in the Norwegian encyclopedia Konungs Skuggsjá (from circa 1250, also by an anonymous author).\n15. They shared many features with the Kraken, namely their gigantic size (as big as an island or mountain) and their inclination to attack ships and their crews.\n16. Therefore, these monsters have been considered as references to the Kraken and perhaps can be treated as the same monster.\n17. Terrible monsters that lurked in the sea and terrorized sailors were sea serpents, reptile-like (sometimes even dragon-like) beasts capable of sinking ships and devouring their crews.\n18. There are countless seamen’s reports about encounters with sea serpents, both in official  naval records and in the scientific and cryptozoological literature (see, chiefly, Magnus, 1555; Gesner, 1587; Ashton, 1890).\n19. Ellis (2004), like Lee (1883) a century before, presents a list of such reports and concludes that the vast majority of them could be reduced to encounters with giant squids (the rest being eels and other fish).\n20. According to these authors, the description of such sea serpents commonly includes: (1) an elongated and sinuous serpentiform body (squids swim with their arms and tentacles held close together and can give the impression of being a serpent); (2) an eyeless and mouthless head (the sailors may only have seen the club of a tentacle or the tip of the mantle above the water level); (3) a water gush that the serpent expelled from its mouth (squids usually use such water jets, expelled through the funnel, to escape and, in this case, to ward off harassing fishermen).\n21. As such, when more closely examined, another common legendary creature, the sea serpent, also becomes a giant squid or, more specifically, Architeuthis.\n22. After a long time away from the literature, the giant squid can be found again in the work of Olaus Magnus (1555), albeit indirectly: he presents descriptions of many monstrous “fishes,” one of which seems to specifically refer to a giant squid.\n23. The Kraken can be found in \"Historiae animalium\" under the guise of a sea serpent, also described by O. Magnus some years earlier.\n24. The oldest certified record of a giant squid (rediscovered by Norwegian naturalist Japetus Steenstrup in 1849), besides Aristotle’s and Pliny’s, seems to be a carcass found in Thingøre Sand, Iceland, in 1639.\n25. At approximately the same time, whalers began to realise that the sperm whales they hunted regurgitated fragments of huge arms when killed, and the sailors did not take long to relate these pieces to the Kraken.\n26. Not even Linnaeus (1735), the father of taxonomy and one of the most prominent figures in the history of biology, could avoid it: he included the Kraken in the first edition of his Systema naturae, where he classified all known organisms.\n27. The name he chose was \"Microcosmus marinus\", later understood as \"Sepia microcosmos\". (Curiously, the cuttlefish,another kind of cephalopod, was and still is classified under the genus Sepia, and the Krakenitself was deemed a cuttlefish on some occasions).\n28. In another work, \"Fauna Svecica\", Linnaeus(1746) also used the classification \"Microcosmus marinus\" for the Kraken, stating that it was a “singular monster” that inhabited the Norwegian seas, despite claiming that he had never personally seen it.\n29. However, Linnaeus later regretted describing an imaginary beast in his scientific works and removed the Kraken from further editions of \"Systema naturae\" (reprint in 1756).\n30. In any case, after this event, everyone (naturalists or not) adopted once and for all theimage of a giant squid for the Kraken; i.e. Linnaeus’s “formal” description of the Kraken marked the point when the mysterious monster took on its modern cephalopod form.\n31. Bishop Erik Pontoppidan describes the Kraken as the world’s largest animal (a circumference of 2.5 km) in his work, \"The natural history of Norway (1752; 1752-1753)\".\n32. The book’s name gives the idea of something more scientifically oriented, but it is actually closer to mythology.\n33. The bishop reports that the Kraken, when rising from the sea, could easily be mistaken for a mountain; its colossal size made it more similar to an island than to an organized being.\n34. To give an idea of the creature’s size, Pontoppidan tells that an entire regiment of soldiers could practice their battle maneuvers on the Kraken’s emerged back.\n35. He also claims that the reports of “floating islands,” common in those days, were actually nothing more than encounters with the Kraken.\n36. Pontoppidan also tells the story of the Bishop of Nidros, who confused the sleeping Kraken with an island: the man and his crew landed on the monster’s back to celebrate a mass and only realized their mistake when the creature woke up."

The Royal Air Force (RAF) stood as the last line of defense against Hitler's Luftwaffe, whose relentless bombing raids threatened to break the spirit of the British people.\nAmong the brave RAF pilots was Flight Lieutenant James Montgomery, known affectionately as \"Monty\" among his comrades. Tall and lean with a square jaw and piercing blue eyes, Monty possessed a calm demeanor that belied his fierce determination in the cockpit of his Spitfire.\nOne fateful day, as the sun hung low on the horizon, Monty and his squadron scrambled to intercept a large formation of German bombers escorted by swarms of Messerschmitt fighters. The sky became a swirling canvas of smoke and fire as dogfights erupted in every direction.\nMonty's squadron engaged the enemy with ferocity, weaving through the clouds and diving towards the Luftwaffe formations with deadly intent. But amidst the chaos of aerial combat, disaster struck as Flight Officer Carter, a young pilot under Monty's command, found himself targeted by a group of enemy fighters.\nMonty watched in horror as Carter's Spitfire took a barrage of hits, smoke billowing from its engines as it began to spiral out of control. Without hesitation, Monty broke formation and dove towards Carter's stricken plane, his heart pounding in his chest.\nAs he closed in on Carter's aircraft, Monty could see the young pilot struggling to maintain control, his cockpit engulfed in flames. With nerves of steel, Monty maneuvered his Spitfire underneath Carter's faltering plane, positioning himself to offer assistance.\n\"Come on, Carter, bail out!\" Monty shouted over the radio, his voice tinged with urgency.\nBut Carter, disoriented and panic-stricken, hesitated, his hands trembling on the controls.\n\"We can't hold much longer, Carter! You've got to jump!\" Monty urged, his eyes scanning the sky for any sign of enemy fighters closing in.\nWith a final desperate nod, Carter ejected from his stricken aircraft, his parachute blossoming open just seconds before his Spitfire plunged earthward in a fiery explosion.\nMonty watched the scene unfold with a mixture of relief and sorrow, his heart heavy with the knowledge that not every pilot would be as fortunate as Carter. But there was no time to dwell on the loss as he found himself suddenly surrounded by a swarm of enemy fighters, their guns blazing with deadly intent.\nDrawing on years of training and instinct honed in countless hours of aerial combat, Monty fought with unparalleled skill and determination, his Spitfire dancing through the sky with grace and precision. He barrel-rolled and looped, using every trick in the book to evade the enemy's fire and gain the upper hand.\nBut the odds were against him, and for every enemy fighter he downed, two more seemed to take its place. Monty knew he couldn't keep this up much longer; his fuel was running low, and his ammunition was nearly spent.\nWith a heavy heart, Monty made the decision to break off the engagement and make a run for it, hoping to lead the enemy away from the vulnerable civilian targets below. With a burst of speed, he dove towards the cloud cover, his pursuers hot on his tail.\nFor what felt like an eternity, Monty flew on, the roar of enemy engines growing fainter behind him. And then, just when he thought he couldn't hold out any longer, he burst through the clouds and saw the familiar coastline of England stretching out before him.\nWith a whoop of triumph, Monty pushed his throttle to the limit and raced for home, his heart soaring with relief at having cheated death once again. As he touched down on the runway and taxied his Spitfire back to the hangar, he knew that he had been part of something truly extraordinary, a battle that would be remembered for generations to come as a testament to the courage and resilience of the human spirit.\nAnd though the scars of war would never fully heal, Monty knew that as long as there were men and women like him willing to stand up and fight for what was right, the light of freedom would never be extinguished."

                "0": " The Florentine humanist and chancellor Leonardo Bruni (Arezzo, 1370 - Florence, March 9, 1444) recounts the journey to Constance he made between November and December 1414 in a letter from his private epistolary (IV 3 according to the edition edited by Lorenzo Mehus, Leonardi Bruni Aretini Epistolarum libri VIII, I, Florentiae, ex typographia Bernardi Paperinii, 1741, pp. 102-109) addressed to his friend Niccolò Niccoli, also a humanist in the Florentine circle. Bruni, who in those years held the post of apostolic secretary on behalf of Pope John XXIII, headed to the German city along with the entourage of curials in the pontiff's service to attend the work of the Council, which met in Constance to reestablish the unity of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches and thus end the Western Schism.In order to reach Pope John XXIII, who made his entrance in Constance as early as October 28, Bruni had to move from Rome with the other members of the Curia a few weeks later, for in the letter he states that he arrived in Verona on November 27 («Veronam ad V Kalendas Decembris cum satis mane venissem») and stayed there for two days, during which he had the opportunity to admire some of the city’s principal beauties, «nonnulla antiqua et visu digna». Bruni’s transalpine journey to Constance begins from this city.Bruni's journey to Constance coincides for an initial stretch with part of the ancient Via Claudia Augusta, the route built in the first century by Emperor Augustus to connect the territories of the empire with the new annexations of Rhaetia and Vindelicia. Bruni begins, then, the journey to Constance by following the lower course of the Adige River until he reaches the foothills of the Alps, where he pauses to admire the exact point where the river, coming out of the plain, creeps between the mountains. Bruni describes in particular the narrow valleys and passages of the river between the steep mountain walls on his right, while on the left the landscape is even more impervious, with eddies of water meandering between high cliffs and sharp rocks silhouetted against the sky.Bruni arrives in the city of Trento, of which he appreciates the urbanitas and the happy geographical location, set in a wide valley where the Adige River becomes more placid, in contrast to the harshness of the places just outside the center and the incivility of the people who live there. It is not only the geographical element that attracts Bruni’s attention: walking through the streets of the city and meeting the locals, the humanist is immediately struck by the bilingual speech of the inhabitants, since \"viri mulieresque et cetera multitudo intra una moenia constituti alii Italico, alii Germanico sermone utuntur\". This particular condition is due - Bruni knows this well and makes it explicit - precisely to the geographical position of the region, squeezed between Italian and German territories.Of this pulcherrimus village located east of the Adige River and west of Mount Roen (\"in sinistro montem trans amnem positum\"), Bruni is immediately struck by the great winemaking tradition that still constitutes the distinctive feature of the municipality and the entire area. When observing the expanses of vines that characterize the area, Bruni notices the clear, almost snowy color of the soil that still gives rise to the delicious white wine of Tramin, a product of excellence renowned throughout the world.When Bruni arrives in Merano, the suburb appears to be without walls and so small in extent that the humanist is uncertain whether to call it oppidum or vicus. The center, however, precisely in the 13th-14th centuries experienced the start of a rich phase of economic and urban development, which is evidently perceived by Bruni when he writes that \"Omnia quippe sunt ad urbis sufficientiam\" and that both Termeno and Marano are \"opulentissimis locis.\"The group arrives at the vast plateau of the Reschen Pass in the Vinschgau, which contains two lakes of modest size. The humanist points out that from each of them, \"parvo inter se spatio distantes\", two \"aquarum divortia\" divide: from the southernmost lake, that is San Valentino alla Muta, flows the Adige, while from the one \"qui Germaniam versus aspicit\", that is, the northernmost Resia Lake, flows a tributary of the Danube, the Inn River. In fact, Bruni, though meticulous in his observational and descriptive skills, commits an inaccuracy, since, while in fact the Adige River has its source in Lake Resia and is then diverted into Lake Muta, the Inn has its source in Lake Lunghin, located to the southwest in the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland. Bruni, however, still had to cross the course of the Inn on his way up the river eastward along the Swiss-Italian border. To cross the pass and begin the descent, Bruni and his traveling companions crossed a forested and impassable valley, which the humanist describes in the letter by citing the different varieties of trees he had been able to recognize along the way: scots pines, cypresses, ash trees, beech trees, and hornbeams.The group of travelers reaches the Arlberg Pass, at 1793 meters above sea level. At this point the route, three thousand steps long (about 2 km), becomes extremely difficult, as Bruni writes in the letter, \"Huius montis transitus longe difficillimus, atque asperrimus fuit\", because of the steep terrain and the high and still fresh snow. This, however, does not prevent Bruni from observing the beauty of the surrounding nature, so rugged and untouched, with a mixture of awe and fear.After about fifteen kilometers, the group can finally leave the Alps and the Arlberg mount behind, and makes its entrance into Valcircium, today Feldkirch, \"oppidum [...] opulentum atque urbanum\" where it stops to spend the night. The town appears to Bruni to be very pleasant and well-kept, rich in vineyards and orchards: \"aedificia habet speciosa, vinetis et pometis plurimum abundat\".Bruni and his company, having traveled about 4 km from Feldkirch, arrive at the banks of the Rhine River, which they must cross from side to side. Here Bruni meticulously describes the origin of the river, which springs from the Alps not far from their location, and the characteristics of the riverbed, with its sinuous and rapidus course."

                "0": " As the sun was setting on August 18th 2003, the night fishermen of Hahaya village eased their wooden pirogues off the jagged lava rocks and slid into the water. The ocean off the western coast of Grande Comore was calm and as the half-moon rose, they could see the volcano of Karthala silhouetted against the darkening sky. A few hundred metres offshore, one of the fishermen, a veteran of decades of nights on the dark water, laid his paddles across the boat and prepared a line. He tied two flat black stones above a baited hook, then let the fine filament slip through his fingers until it touched the seabed, deep below. He was waiting for the nibble and tug of a fish—a snapper or a grouper, perhaps, or if he was lucky, a marlin, which he would take the next morning to sell at the market in Moroni. But this time the tug was unfamiliar, and the old fisherman fought with the line before he managed to pull the fish to the surface. Deep water at night is ink-black and the first thing he saw was a pair of eyes, glowing pink in the pale moonlight. As they surfaced, he could make out a large fish. He recognised it instantly as a gombessa, or coelacanth (pronounced see-la-kanth). Although rarely caught, it was known to all in the Comoros as their most precious asset, a fish that some said was the ancestor of man. Only six coelacanths had been caught in the waters off Hahaya since 1966, and none in the previous five years, but the old fisherman knew what to do. He tethered it to the back of the boat and paddled back to the village. He knew there was little time to lose as gombessa live in the ocean depths and had never survived for more than a few hours at the surface. Determined to try, he made a safe water pool, and waited for the sun to rise. The next morning, his nephew took the first bus into Moroni and went straight to the Centre National de Documentation et de Recherche Scientifique (CNDRS)—a handsome white building off the central roundabout in Moroni, which houses the national museum and archives. He told them about the catch. It was what they had been waiting for since the previous year, when Professor Rosemary Dorrington of Rhodes University in the Eastern Cape had visited the island to talk about a new project—the African Coelacanth Ecosystem Programme (ACEP)—that had been set up in South Africa. She had left behind some equipment and instructions on what to do if a coelacanth was caught. Her point man in Moroni was Said Ahamada, a young environmentalist. Ahamada was at home when the phone rang. He rushed to the CNDRS, grabbed the collecting kit and then caught a bush taxi to Hahaya. “It was very emotional,” he remembers. “I was very impatient to see the fish. And when I got there it was still moving a little. It was a very big female, close to two metres, and had already turned brown. But its eyes were still shining; it was amazing to see lights coming from its eyes.” The coelacanth was hauled out of the water and laid on white plastic sacking, where, almost immediately, it died. Following Dorrington’s instructions, Ahamada took blood samples. He paid the fisherman, then heaved the coelacanth, still wrapped in its sacking, into the boot of a red hire car and, clutching the vial of blood, careered back to Moroni. The fish was laid out on a table at CNDRS. Ahamada cut carefully into its side and extracted samples from all the major organs—liver, heart, blood and gills. He carefully put each of them through a small manual meat-grinder, specially adapted for the task in case a lack of electricity made it impossible to use a blender, to homogenise the tissue. The samples were stored in the CNDRS freezer. \"I was excited that this fish from the Comoros was going to be used for science,\" Ahamada says. \"But at that time I had no idea how important it would be.\" It wasn’t for another decade—until April this year—that he would find out exactly how important. In 1839, the Swiss scientist Louis Agassiz described a fossil fish that had been found in Permian marl slate near Durham in the north of England. He named it Coelacanthus (from the Greek for hollow spine) granulatus (for the tubercular ornamentation on the surface of its scales). Over the decades, similar fossils were found across the world, dating from around 380m years ago to around 70m years ago, when the fossil record disappeared and the coelacanth was assumed to have become extinct. Coelacanths are the size of humans. They are slate blue when alive, with white flecks on the thick scales that cover their bodies. They live in the gloaming, around 200-400 meters below the surface, where light barely penetrates and few creatures venture. They spend their days sheltering in rocky caves in small groups, coming up to feed at night as the water above them cools. Unlike most fish, they give birth to live young—small, perfectly formed baby coelacanths—and when disturbed they lift themselves into headstands, apparently using an electro-sensory organ in their snout to detect the presence of predators or prey. The handful of people who have seen them in their natural habitat talk of their glowing eyes and their gentle demeanour. They describe coelacanths moving with surprising grace, deploying their fanned fins in a diagonal formation—right fin in front, left trailing behind—that is similar to a lizard walking. It was those fins that first excited the attention of scientists, nearly two centuries ago. In the coelacanth’s lobed fins, palaeontologists thought they saw clues to the identity of the \"missing link\", the first fish that crawled out of the sea to evolve into amphibians, reptiles, mammals and, eventually, man. They postulated that the lobed fins of the fossil coelacanths suggested that they were the ancestor of the first fish that crawled out of the sea. Others put their money on the lungfish, the first living specimen of which had been discovered in the Amazon in the 1830s by Johann Natterer, a Viennese naturalist. Natterer had returned to Vienna from a collecting expedition with an eel-shaped creature, around two feet long, with both gills and functioning lungs, which he suggested in a monograph was a \"new species of animal of the family of fish-like reptiles\" (Ichthyodea)."

                "0": " Many monsters appear in old sea stories. Among the others, the Aspidochelone (or Fastitocalon), a creature similar to an island; the bishop-fish (also known as the sea bishop, sea monk or monk-fish), a sea monster whose legend might also have originated from encounters with seals, sharks or walruses; and, even the biblical Leviathan. Myth around these creatures has lived at least up to mid 1800 and is still alive in some cultures. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (fourth century BC), in his work \"The history of animals\", distinguished the common squid (teuthis) from its larger and rarer cousin (teuthus or, in some translations, teuthos), which could reach 2.3m in length. Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (first century AD), in his work \"Natural history\", described a giant squid, which had a body “as large as a barrel” and tentacles reaching 9.1m in length. Curiously, In Pliny's (as well as in Aristotle's) works, the giant squid was treated as a common animal and did not belong to myths of their ages. However, some later authors, especially in fictional literature, made thismistake. In fact, the Kraken’s legend originated from sailors’ accounts dating from a millennium after the age of Pliny. The legend of the Kraken was born from seamen’s stories, but it was much modified and strengthened over the years. Right from the start, the Kraken was universally incorporated into Nordic mythology and folklore. According to an obscure, ancient manuscript of circa 1180 by King Sverre of Norway, the Kraken was just one of many sea monsters. Still, it had its own peculiarities: it was colossal in size, as large as an island, and capable of sinking ships; it haunted the seas between Norway and Iceland, and between Iceland and Greenland. Two Nordic sea monsters have records almost as old as the Kraken, appearing in the “Saga of Örvar-Oddr” (an Icelandic story from the thirteenth century by an anonymous author); their names are Hafgufa (“sea-mist”) and Lyngbakr (“heather-back”). The habits of theses monsters were later described in the Norwegian encyclopedia Konungs Skuggsjá (from circa 1250, also by an anonymous author). They shared many features with the Kraken, namely their gigantic size (as big as an island or mountain) and their inclination to attack ships and their crews. Therefore, these monsters have been considered as references to the Kraken and perhaps can be treated as the same monster. Terrible monsters that lurked in the sea and terrorized sailors were sea serpents, reptile-like (sometimes even dragon-like) beasts capable of sinking ships and devouring their crews. There are countless seamen’s reports about encounters with sea serpents, both in official naval records and in the scientific and cryptozoological literature (see, chiefly, Magnus, 1555; Gesner, 1587; Ashton, 1890). Ellis (2004), like Lee (1883) a century before, presents a list of such reports and concludes that the vast majority of them could be reduced to encounters with giant squids (the rest being eels and other fish). According to these authors, the description of such sea serpents commonly includes: (1) an elongated and sinuous serpentiform body (squids swim with their arms and tentacles held close together and can give the impression of being a serpent); (2) an eyeless and mouthless head (the sailors may only have seen the club of a tentacle or the tip of the mantle above the water level); (3) a water gush that the serpent expelled from its mouth (squids usually use such water jets, expelled through the funnel, to escape and, in this case, to ward off harassing fishermen). As such, when more closely examined, another common legendary creature, the sea serpent, also becomes a giant squid or, more specifically, Architeuthis. After a long time away from the literature, the giant squid can be found again in the work of Olaus Magnus (1555), albeit indirectly: he presents descriptions of many monstrous “fishes,” one of which seems to specifically refer to a giant squid. The Kraken can be found in \"Historiae animalium\" under the guise of a sea serpent, also described by O. Magnus some years earlier. The oldest certified record of a giant squid (rediscovered by Norwegian naturalist Japetus Steenstrup in 1849), besides Aristotle’s and Pliny’s, seems to be a carcass found in Thingøre Sand, Iceland, in 1639. At approximately the same time, whalers began to realise that the sperm whales they hunted regurgitated fragments of huge arms when killed, and the sailors did not take long to relate these pieces to the Kraken. Not even Linnaeus (1735), the father of taxonomy and one of the most prominent figures in the history of biology, could avoid it: he included the Kraken in the first edition of his Systema naturae, where he classified all known organisms. The name he chose was \"Microcosmus marinus\", later understood as \"Sepia microcosmos\". (Curiously, the cuttlefish,another kind of cephalopod, was and still is classified under the genus Sepia, and the Krakenitself was deemed a cuttlefish on some occasions). In another work, \"Fauna Svecica\", Linnaeus(1746) also used the classification \"Microcosmus marinus\" for the Kraken, stating that it was a “singular monster” that inhabited the Norwegian seas, despite claiming that he had never personally seen it. However, Linnaeus later regretted describing an imaginary beast in his scientific works and removed the Kraken from further editions of \"Systema naturae\" (reprint in 1756). In any case, after this event, everyone (naturalists or not) adopted once and for all theimage of a giant squid for the Kraken; i.e. Linnaeus’s “formal” description of the Kraken marked the point when the mysterious monster took on its modern cephalopod form. Bishop Erik Pontoppidan describes the Kraken as the world’s largest animal (a circumference of 2.5 km) in his work, \"The natural history of Norway (1752; 1752-1753)\". The book’s name gives the idea of something more scientifically oriented, but it is actually closer to mythology. The bishop reports that the Kraken, when rising from the sea, could easily be mistaken for a mountain; its colossal size made it more similar to an island than to an organized being. To give an idea of the creature’s size, Pontoppidan tells that an entire regiment of soldiers could practice their battle maneuvers on the Kraken’s emerged back. He also claims that the reports of “floating islands,” common in those days, were actually nothing more than encounters with the Kraken. Pontoppidan also tells the story of the Bishop of Nidros, who confused the sleeping Kraken with an island: the man and his crew landed on the monster’s back to celebrate a mass and only realized their mistake when the creature woke up."

                "0": " Once upon a time, in the mystical land of Eldoria, where magic flowed like a gentle river and fantastical creatures roamed freely, there lived a young sorcerer named Aria. Aria possessed a rare gift - the ability to communicate with the ancient spirits that dwelled in the heart of the Enchanted Forest. Her emerald-green eyes sparkled with the wisdom of the ages, and her long, flowing hair shimmered like moonlight. Eldoria was a realm of balance, where light and darkness coexisted in harmony. However, an ominous shadow had begun to creep across the land, threatening to disrupt the delicate equilibrium. Aria sensed the growing unrest among the spirits and knew that she was destined to play a crucial role in restoring the balance. Guided by a vision, Aria set out on a quest to seek the Oracle of Whispers, a mystical being who resided atop the Silver Peak, the tallest mountain in Eldoria. Legends spoke of the Oracle's ability to unveil the secrets of the past, present, and future. Aria hoped that the Oracle would provide her with the knowledge needed to confront the encroaching darkness. As she ventured deeper into the Enchanted Forest, Aria encountered magical creatures who became her steadfast companions. There was Luna, a graceful unicorn with a silvery mane that glowed with ethereal light, and Ember, a mischievous fire sprite who danced around Aria, leaving trails of warmth and light in her wake. The journey was fraught with challenges as Aria faced enchanted puzzles, treacherous terrain, and the cunning tricks of mischievous forest spirits. Yet, with each obstacle overcome, Aria grew stronger in her resolve. Finally, after a perilous climb, Aria reached the summit of the Silver Peak. The Oracle of Whispers, a luminous being cloaked in a robe of shifting shadows, awaited her. The oracle spoke in a melodic voice that echoed through the mountaintop, revealing the ancient prophecy that foretold Aria's arrival. \"The balance of Eldoria teeters on the edge of darkness. To restore harmony, you must embark on a quest to retrieve the Crystal of Luminescence from the heart of the Labyrinth of Shadows,\" the Oracle intoned. With newfound determination, Aria descended from the Silver Peak and embarked on the next phase of her quest. The Labyrinth of Shadows was a maze of illusions, where reality twisted and turned like the tendrils of a mystical fog. Aria relied on her intuition, the guidance of the spirits, and the unwavering loyalty of Luna and Ember to navigate the labyrinth's twists and turns. After facing trials that tested her wit and courage, Aria reached the heart of the labyrinth, where the Crystal of Luminescence awaited. The crystal pulsed with a radiant energy that banished the surrounding darkness. Aria knew that this precious artifact held the key to restoring balance to Eldoria. As she emerged from the labyrinth, Aria felt a surge of power coursing through her veins. The enchanted crystal hovered above her hand, casting a warm, golden glow that dispelled the shadows that had plagued the land. The spirits of Eldoria rejoiced, their ethereal voices harmonizing in a melody that resonated across the realm. Aria returned to the Enchanted Forest, where she thanked Luna and Ember for their unwavering companionship. The once-ominous shadow that had loomed over Eldoria dissipated, and the land was bathed in the gentle radiance of restored balance. As Aria stood amidst the vibrant foliage of the Enchanted Forest, basking in the newfound harmony she had helped to bring about, she felt a sense of fulfillment wash over her. The whispers of the ancient spirits now carried messages of gratitude and hope, their voices echoing through the trees like a soothing melody. But even as peace settled over Eldoria once more, Aria knew that her journey was far from over. The Oracle's words lingered in her mind, reminding her of the delicate balance that must always be maintained in the realm. With the Crystal of Luminescence cradled safely in her hands, Aria understood that she held a powerful tool—one that would aid her in protecting Eldoria from future threats. As she contemplated her next steps, Luna nudged her gently with her shimmering horn, her eyes reflecting the wisdom of ages past. Ember danced around them, her flames flickering brightly with anticipation. Together, they were a formidable team, bound by friendship and a shared purpose. With renewed determination, Aria set forth once more, her heart filled with courage and hope. Guided by the whispers of the spirits and the light of the crystal, she embarked on a journey to explore the far reaches of Eldoria, seeking out new allies and confronting the challenges that lay ahead. Along the way, she encountered ancient ruins hidden deep within the forest, where forgotten magic lay dormant, waiting to be awakened. She traversed mystical rivers and crossed towering mountain ranges, each step bringing her closer to uncovering the secrets of her world. But amidst the beauty and wonder of Eldoria, Aria remained ever vigilant, knowing that darkness could still lurk in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to rise again. With the Crystal of Luminescence as her guide, she vowed to protect her homeland and preserve the balance that had been restored. And so, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the stars twinkled overhead, Aria continued her journey, a beacon of light and hope in a world touched by magic and mystery. For in the land of Eldoria, where the forces of light and darkness danced in eternal harmony, her quest was far from over."

The Royal Air Force (RAF) stood as the last line of defense against Hitler's Luftwaffe, whose relentless bombing raids threatened to break the spirit of the British people.\n\nAmong the brave RAF pilots was Flight Lieutenant James Montgomery, known affectionately as \"Monty\" among his comrades. Tall and lean with a square jaw and piercing blue eyes, Monty possessed a calm demeanor that belied his fierce determination in the cockpit of his Spitfire.\n\nOne fateful day, as the sun hung low on the horizon, Monty and his squadron scrambled to intercept a large formation of German bombers escorted by swarms of Messerschmitt fighters. The sky became a swirling canvas of smoke and fire as dogfights erupted in every direction.\n\nMonty's squadron engaged the enemy with ferocity, weaving through the clouds and diving towards the Luftwaffe formations with deadly intent. But amidst the chaos of aerial combat, disaster struck as Flight Officer Carter, a young pilot under Monty's command, found himself targeted by a group of enemy fighters.\n\nMonty watched in horror as Carter's Spitfire took a barrage of hits, smoke billowing from its engines as it began to spiral out of control. Without hesitation, Monty broke formation and dove towards Carter's stricken plane, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\nAs he closed in on Carter's aircraft, Monty could see the young pilot struggling to maintain control, his cockpit engulfed in flames. With nerves of steel, Monty maneuvered his Spitfire underneath Carter's faltering plane, positioning himself to offer assistance.\n\n\"Come on, Carter, bail out!\" Monty shouted over the radio, his voice tinged with urgency.\n\nBut Carter, disoriented and panic-stricken, hesitated, his hands trembling on the controls.\n\n\"We can't hold much longer, Carter! You've got to jump!\" Monty urged, his eyes scanning the sky for any sign of enemy fighters closing in.\n\nWith a final desperate nod, Carter ejected from his stricken aircraft, his parachute blossoming open just seconds before his Spitfire plunged earthward in a fiery explosion.\n\nMonty watched the scene unfold with a mixture of relief and sorrow, his heart heavy with the knowledge that not every pilot would be as fortunate as Carter. But there was no time to dwell on the loss as he found himself suddenly surrounded by a swarm of enemy fighters, their guns blazing with deadly intent.\n\nDrawing on years of training and instinct honed in countless hours of aerial combat, Monty fought with unparalleled skill and determination, his Spitfire dancing through the sky with grace and precision. He barrel-rolled and looped, using every trick in the book to evade the enemy's fire and gain the upper hand.\n\nBut the odds were against him, and for every enemy fighter he downed, two more seemed to take its place. Monty knew he couldn't keep this up much longer; his fuel was running low, and his ammunition was nearly spent.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Monty made the decision to break off the engagement and make a run for it, hoping to lead the enemy away from the vulnerable civilian targets below. With a burst of speed, he dove towards the cloud cover, his pursuers hot on his tail.\n\nFor what felt like an eternity, Monty flew on, the roar of enemy engines growing fainter behind him. And then, just when he thought he couldn't hold out any longer, he burst through the clouds and saw the familiar coastline of England stretching out before him.\n\nWith a whoop of triumph, Monty pushed his throttle to the limit and raced for home, his heart soaring with relief at having cheated death once again. As he touched down on the runway and taxied his Spitfire back to the hangar, he knew that he had been part of something truly extraordinary, a battle that would be remembered for generations to come as a testament to the courage and resilience of the human spirit.\n\nAnd though the scars of war would never fully heal, Monty knew that as long as there were men and women like him willing to stand up and fight for what was right, the light of freedom would never be extinguished."

                "1": " The Florentine humanist and chancellor Leonardo Bruni (Arezzo, 1370 - Florence, March 9, 1444) recounts the journey to Constance he made between November and December 1414 in a letter from his private epistolary (IV 3 according to the edition edited by Lorenzo Mehus, Leonardi Bruni Aretini Epistolarum libri VIII, I, Florentiae, ex typographia Bernardi Paperinii, 1741, pp. 102-109) addressed to his friend Niccolò Niccoli, also a humanist in the Florentine circle. Bruni, who in those years held the post of apostolic secretary on behalf of Pope John XXIII, headed to the German city along with the entourage of curials in the pontiff's service to attend the work of the Council, which met in Constance to reestablish the unity of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches and thus end the Western Schism.\n\nIn order to reach Pope John XXIII, who made his entrance in Constance as early as October 28, Bruni had to move from Rome with the other members of the Curia a few weeks later, for in the letter he states that he arrived in Verona on November 27 («Veronam ad V Kalendas Decembris cum satis mane venissem») and stayed there for two days, during which he had the opportunity to admire some of the city’s principal beauties, «nonnulla antiqua et visu digna». Bruni’s transalpine journey to Constance begins from this city.\n\nBruni's journey to Constance coincides for an initial stretch with part of the ancient Via Claudia Augusta, the route built in the first century by Emperor Augustus to connect the territories of the empire with the new annexations of Rhaetia and Vindelicia. Bruni begins, then, the journey to Constance by following the lower course of the Adige River until he reaches the foothills of the Alps, where he pauses to admire the exact point where the river, coming out of the plain, creeps between the mountains. Bruni describes in particular the narrow valleys and passages of the river between the steep mountain walls on his right, while on the left the landscape is even more impervious, with eddies of water meandering between high cliffs and sharp rocks silhouetted against the sky.\n\nBruni arrives in the city of Trento, of which he appreciates the urbanitas and the happy geographical location, set in a wide valley where the Adige River becomes more placid, in contrast to the harshness of the places just outside the center and the incivility of the people who live there. It is not only the geographical element that attracts Bruni’s attention: walking through the streets of the city and meeting the locals, the humanist is immediately struck by the bilingual speech of the inhabitants, since \"viri mulieresque et cetera multitudo intra una moenia constituti alii Italico, alii Germanico sermone utuntur\". This particular condition is due - Bruni knows this well and makes it explicit - precisely to the geographical position of the region, squeezed between Italian and German territories.\n\nOf this pulcherrimus village located east of the Adige River and west of Mount Roen (\"in sinistro montem trans amnem positum\"), Bruni is immediately struck by the great winemaking tradition that still constitutes the distinctive feature of the municipality and the entire area. When observing the expanses of vines that characterize the area, Bruni notices the clear, almost snowy color of the soil that still gives rise to the delicious white wine of Tramin, a product of excellence renowned throughout the world.\n\nWhen Bruni arrives in Merano, the suburb appears to be without walls and so small in extent that the humanist is uncertain whether to call it oppidum or vicus. The center, however, precisely in the 13th-14th centuries experienced the start of a rich phase of economic and urban development, which is evidently perceived by Bruni when he writes that \"Omnia quippe sunt ad urbis sufficientiam\" and that both Termeno and Marano are \"opulentissimis locis.\"\n\nThe group arrives at the vast plateau of the Reschen Pass in the Vinschgau, which contains two lakes of modest size. The humanist points out that from each of them, \"parvo inter se spatio distantes,\" two \"aquarum divortia\" divide: from the southernmost lake, that is San Valentino alla Muta, flows the Adige, while from the one \"qui Germaniam versus aspicit,\" that is, the northernmost Resia Lake, flows a tributary of the Danube, the Inn River. In fact, Bruni, though meticulous in his observational and descriptive skills, commits an inaccuracy, since, while in fact the Adige River has its source in Lake Resia and is then diverted into Lake Muta, the Inn has its source in Lake Lunghin, located to the southwest in the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland. Bruni, however, still had to cross the course of the Inn on his way up the river eastward along the Swiss-Italian border. To cross the pass and begin the descent, Bruni and his traveling companions crossed a forested and impassable valley, which the humanist describes in the letter by citing the different varieties of trees he had been able to recognize along the way: scots pines, cypresses, ash trees, beech trees, and hornbeams.\n\nThe group of travelers reaches the Arlberg Pass, at 1793 meters above sea level. At this point the route, three thousand steps long (about 2 km), becomes extremely difficult, as Bruni writes in the letter, \"Huius montis transitus longe difficillimus, atque asperrimus fuit\", because of the steep terrain and the high and still fresh snow. This, however, does not prevent Bruni from observing the beauty of the surrounding nature, so rugged and untouched, with a mixture of awe and fear.\n\nAfter about fifteen kilometers, the group can finally leave the Alps and the Arlberg mount behind, and makes its entrance into Valcircium, today Feldkirch, \"oppidum [...] opulentum atque urbanum\" where it stops to spend the night. The town appears to Bruni to be very pleasant and well-kept, rich in vineyards and orchards: \"aedificia habet speciosa, vinetis et pometis plurimum abundat\".\n\nBruni and his company, having traveled about 4 km from Feldkirch, arrive at the banks of the Rhine River, which they must cross from side to side. Here Bruni meticulously describes the origin of the river, which springs from the Alps not far from their location, and the characteristics of the riverbed, with its sinuous and rapidus course."

The ocean off the western coast of Grande Comore was calm and as the half-moon rose, they could see the volcano of Karthala silhouetted against the darkening sky. A few hundred metres offshore, one of the fishermen, a veteran of decades of nights on the dark water, laid his paddles across the boat and prepared a line. He tied two flat black stones above a baited hook, then let the fine filament slip through his fingers until it touched the seabed, deep below. He was waiting for the nibble and tug of a fish—a snapper or a grouper, perhaps, or if he was lucky, a marlin, which he would take the next morning to sell at the market in Moroni. But this time the tug was unfamiliar, and the old fisherman fought with the line before he managed to pull the fish to the surface. Deep water at night is ink-black and the first thing he saw was a pair of eyes, glowing pink in the pale moonlight. As they surfaced, he could make out a large fish. He recognised it instantly as a gombessa, or coelacanth (pronounced see-la-kanth). Although rarely caught, it was known to all in the Comoros as their most precious asset, a fish that some said was the ancestor of man. Only six coelacanths had been caught in the waters off Hahaya since 1966, and none in the previous five years, but the old fisherman knew what to do. He tethered it to the back of the boat and paddled back to the village. He knew there was little time to lose as gombessa live in the ocean depths and had never survived for more than a few hours at the surface. Determined to try, he made a safe water pool, and waited for the sun to rise. The next morning, his nephew took the first bus into Moroni and went straight to the Centre National de Documentation et de Recherche Scientifique (CNDRS)—a handsome white building off the central roundabout in Moroni, which houses the national museum and archives.

It was what they had been waiting for since the previous year, when Professor Rosemary Dorrington of Rhodes University in the Eastern Cape had visited the island to talk about a new project—the African Coelacanth Ecosystem Programme (ACEP)—that had been set up in South Africa. She had left behind some equipment and instructions on what to do if a coelacanth was caught. Her point man in Moroni was Said Ahamada, a young environmentalist. Ahamada was at home when the phone rang. He rushed to the CNDRS, grabbed the collecting kit and then caught a bush taxi to Hahaya. “It was very emotional,” he remembers. “I was very impatient to see the fish. And when I got there it was still moving a little. It was a very big female, close to two metres, and had already turned brown. But its eyes were still shining; it was amazing to see lights coming from its eyes.” The coelacanth was hauled out of the water and laid on white plastic sacking, where, almost immediately, it died. Following Dorrington’s instructions, Ahamada took blood samples. He paid the fisherman, then heaved the coelacanth, still wrapped in its sacking, into the boot of a red hire car and, clutching the vial of blood, careered back to Moroni. The fish was laid out on a table at CNDRS. Ahamada cut carefully into its side and extracted samples from all the major organs—liver, heart, blood and gills. He carefully put each of them through a small manual meat-grinder, specially adapted for the task in case a lack of electricity made it impossible to use a blender, to homogenise the tissue. The samples were stored in the CNDRS freezer. \"I was excited that this fish from the Comoros was going to be used for science,\" Ahamada says. \"But at that time I had no idea how important it would be.\" It wasn’t for another decade—until April this year—that he would find out exactly how important. In 1839, the Swiss scientist Louis Agassiz described a fossil fish that had been found in Permian marl slate near Durham in the north of England. He named it Coelacanthus (from the Greek for hollow spine) granulatus (for the tubercular ornamentation on the surface of its scales). Over the decades, similar fossils were found across the world, dating from around 380m years ago to around 70m years ago, when the fossil record disappeared and the coelacanth was assumed to have become extinct. Coelacanths are the size of humans. They are slate blue when alive, with white flecks on the thick scales that cover their bodies. They live in the gloaming, around 200-400 meters below the surface, where light barely penetrates and few creatures venture. They spend their days sheltering in rocky caves in small groups, coming up to feed at night as the water above them cools. Unlike most fish, they give birth to live young—small, perfectly formed baby coelacanths—and when disturbed they lift themselves into headstands, apparently using an electro-sensory organ in their snout to detect the presence of predators or prey. The handful of people who have seen them in their natural habitat talk of their glowing eyes and their gentle demeanour. They describe coelacanths moving with surprising grace, deploying their fanned fins in a diagonal formation—right fin in front, left trailing behind—that is similar to a lizard walking. It was those fins that first excited the attention of scientists, nearly two centuries ago. In the coelacanth’s lobed fins, palaeontologists thought they saw clues to the identity of the \"missing link\", the first fish that crawled out of the sea to evolve into amphibians, reptiles, mammals and, eventually, man. They postulated that the lobed fins of the fossil coelacanths suggested that they were the ancestor of the first fish that crawled out of the sea. Others put their money on the lungfish, the first living specimen of which had been discovered in the Amazon in the 1830s by Johann Natterer, a Viennese naturalist. Natterer had returned to Vienna from a collecting expedition with an eel-shaped creature, around two feet long, with both gills and functioning lungs, which he suggested in a monograph was a \"new species of animal of the family of fish-like reptiles\" (Ichthyodea)."

                "0": " Many monsters appear in old sea stories. Among the others, the Aspidochelone (or Fastitocalon), a creature similar to an island; the bishop-fish (also known as the sea bishop, sea monk or monk-fish), a sea monster whose legend might also have originated from encounters with seals, sharks or walruses; and, even the biblical Leviathan. Myth around these creatures has lived at least up to mid 1800 and is still alive in some cultures. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (fourth century BC), in his work \"The history of animals\", distinguished the common squid (teuthis) from its larger and rarer cousin (teuthus or, in some translations, teuthos), which could reach 2.3m in length. Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (first century AD), in his work \"Natural history\", described a giant squid, which had a body “as large as a barrel” and tentacles reaching 9.1m in length. Curiously, In Pliny's (as well as in Aristotle's) works, the giant squid was treated as a common animal and did not belong to myths of their ages. However, some later authors, especially in fictional literature, made this mistake. In fact, the Kraken’s legend originated from sailors’ accounts dating from a millennium after the age of Pliny. The legend of the Kraken was born from seamen’s stories, but it was much modified and strengthened over the years. Right from the start, the Kraken was universally incorporated into Nordic mythology and folklore. According to an obscure, ancient manuscript of circa 1180 by King Sverre of Norway, the Kraken was just one of many sea monsters. Still, it had its own peculiarities: it was colossal in size, as large as an island, and capable of sinking ships; it haunted the seas between Norway and Iceland, and between Iceland and Greenland. Two Nordic sea monsters have records almost as old as the Kraken, appearing in the “Saga of Örvar-Oddr” (an Icelandic story from the thirteenth century by an anonymous author); their names are Hafgufa (“sea-mist”) and Lyngbakr (“heather-back”). The habits of these monsters were later described in the Norwegian encyclopedia Konungs Skuggsjá (from circa 1250, also by an anonymous author). They shared many features with the Kraken, namely their gigantic size (as big as an island or mountain) and their inclination to attack ships and their crews. Therefore, these monsters have been considered as references to the Kraken and perhaps can be treated as the same monster. Terrible monsters that lurked in the sea and terrorized sailors were sea serpents, reptile-like (sometimes even dragon-like) beasts capable of sinking ships and devouring their crews. There are countless seamen’s reports about encounters with sea serpents, both in official naval records and in the scientific and cryptozoological literature (see, chiefly, Magnus, 1555; Gesner, 1587; Ashton, 1890). Ellis (2004), like Lee (1883) a century before, presents a list of such reports and concludes that the vast majority of them could be reduced to encounters with giant squids (the rest being eels and other fish). According to these authors, the description of such sea serpents commonly includes: (1) an elongated and sinuous serpentiform body (squids swim with their arms and tentacles held close together and can give the impression of being a serpent); (2) an eyeless and mouthless head (the sailors may only have seen the club of a tentacle or the tip of the mantle above the water level); (3) a water gush that the serpent expelled from its mouth (squids usually use such water jets, expelled through the funnel, to escape and, in this case, to ward off harassing fishermen). As such, when more closely examined, another common legendary creature, the sea serpent, also becomes a giant squid or, more specifically, Architeuthis. After a long time away from the literature, the giant squid can be found again in the work of Olaus Magnus (1555), albeit indirectly: he presents descriptions of many monstrous “fishes,” one of which seems to specifically refer to a giant squid. The Kraken can be found in \"Historiae animalium\" under the guise of a sea serpent, also described by O. Magnus some years earlier. The oldest certified record of a giant squid (rediscovered by Norwegian naturalist Japetus Steenstrup in 1849), besides Aristotle’s and Pliny’s, seems to be a carcass found in Thingøre Sand, Iceland, in 1639. At approximately the same time, whalers began to realise that the sperm whales they hunted regurgitated fragments of huge arms when killed, and the sailors did not take long to relate these pieces to the Kraken. Not even Linnaeus (1735), the father of taxonomy and one of the most prominent figures in the history of biology, could avoid it: he included the Kraken in the first edition of his Systema naturae, where he classified all known organisms. The name he chose was \"Microcosmus marinus\", later understood as \"Sepia microcosmos\". (Curiously, the cuttlefish, another kind of cephalopod, was and still is classified under the genus Sepia, and the Kraken itself was deemed a cuttlefish on some occasions). In another work, \"Fauna Svecica\", Linnaeus (1746) also used the classification \"Microcosmus marinus\" for the Kraken, stating that it was a “singular monster” that inhabited the Norwegian seas, despite claiming that he had never personally seen it. However, Linnaeus later regretted describing an imaginary beast in his scientific works and removed the Kraken from further editions of \"Systema naturae\" (reprint in 1756). In any case, after this event, everyone (naturalists or not) adopted once and for all the image of a giant squid for the Kraken; i.e. Linnaeus’s “formal” description of the Kraken marked the point when the mysterious monster took on its modern cephalopod form. Bishop Erik Pontoppidan describes the Kraken as the world’s largest animal (a circumference of 2.5 km) in his work, \"The natural history of Norway (1752; 1752-1753)\". The book’s name gives the idea of something more scientifically oriented, but it is actually closer to mythology. The bishop reports that the Kraken, when rising from the sea, could easily be mistaken for a mountain; its colossal size made it more similar to an island than to an organized being. To give an idea of the creature’s size, Pontoppidan tells that an entire regiment of soldiers could practice their battle maneuvers on the Kraken’s emerged back. He also claims that the reports of “floating islands,” common in those days, were actually nothing more than encounters with the Kraken."
