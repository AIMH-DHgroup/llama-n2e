Researchers at NSIDC and NASA use satellites to measure sea ice as it melts and refreezes. They track sea ice extent, which is defined as the total area of the ocean in which the ice cover fraction is at least 15%.\n\nParagraph 4: Between March and September 2023, the Arctic ice cover shrank from a peak area of 5.64 million square miles (14.62 million square kilometers) to 1.63 million square miles (4.23 million square kilometers). That’s roughly 770,000 square miles (1.99 million square kilometers) below the 1981–2010 average minimum of 2.4 million square miles (6.22 million square kilometers). The amount of sea ice lost was enough to cover the entire continental United States.\n\nParagraph 5: Sea ice around Antarctica reached its lowest winter maximum extent on Sept. 10, 2023, at 6.5 million square miles (16.96 million square kilometers). That’s 398,000 square miles (1.03 million square kilometers) below the previous record-low reached in 1986 – a difference that equates to roughly the size of Texas and California combined. The average maximum extent between 1981 and 2010 was 7.22 million square miles (18.71 million square kilometers).\n\nParagraph 6: “It’s a record-smashing sea ice low in the Antarctic,” said Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at NSIDC. “Sea ice growth appears low around nearly the whole continent as opposed to any one region.”"

Her education in mathematics and science was guided by tutors such as Mary Somerville and Augustus De Morgan.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAda's remarkable analytical skills and curiosity soon led her to the work of Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor. In her annotated translation of an article about Babbage's Analytical Engine, Ada introduced notes that extended far beyond mere translation. These notes, which some consider to be the first computer program, detailed how the Analytical Engine could manipulate symbols beyond numbers, including music and art.\n\nParagraph 3:\nAda's visionary ideas laid the foundation for modern programming. \"La máquina de Babbage no es simplemente una calculadora gigante, sino una herramienta capaz de crear arte y música mediante el manejo de símbolos abstractos\", she wrote, emphasizing the potential artistic applications of Babbage's invention. Her insights extended beyond the technical realm, with Ada contemplating the broader societal implications of computing.\n\nParagraph 4:\nIn a letter to her friend Charles Wheatstone, she articulated, \"Les machines de Babbage pourraient un jour influencer profondément la société, modifiant la façon dont nous pensons et travaillons.\" (Babbage's machines could one day profoundly influence society, altering how we think and work.)\n\nParagraph 5:\nAda Lovelace's tragically short life ended in 1852 at the age of 36.

John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet. Turing's mother, Julius's wife, was Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways.\n\nParagraph 3:\nThe Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare. Julius and Ethel married on 1 October 1907 at Bartholomew’s church on Clyde Road, in Dublin.\n\nParagraph 4:\nJulius's work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to Maida Vale, London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912.\n\nParagraph 5:\nTuring had an elder brother, John Ferrier Turing, father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets.\n\nParagraph 6:\nTuring's father's civil service commission was still active during Turing's childhood years, and his parents travelled between Hastings in the United Kingdom and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple.\n\nParagraph 7:\nAt Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a blue plaque. The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's birth.\n\nParagraph 8:\nVery early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.

A Scottish term, the tradition is called \"guising\" because of the disguises or costumes worn by the children.

Smith, in his book Halloween, Hallowed is Thy Name, offers a religious perspective to the wearing of costumes on All Hallows' Eve, suggesting that by dressing up as creatures \"who at one time caused us to fear and tremble\", people are able to poke fun at Satan \"whose kingdom has been plundered by our Saviour\".\n\nParagraph 5:\nImages of skeletons and the dead are traditional decorations used as memento mori.\n\nParagraph 6:\n\"Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF\" is a fundraising program to support UNICEF, a United Nations Programme that provides humanitarian aid to children in developing countries.

It is known that he studied Tuscan poetry and that he admired the compositions of the Bolognese poet Guido Guinizelli. At a time when the Sicilian School was becoming known in Tuscany, he also discovered the Provençal poetry of the troubadours and the Latin writers of classical antiquity.\n\nParagraph 2:\nDante's interactions with Beatrice set an example of courtly love. His experience of such love was typical, but his expression of it was unique. It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the dolce stil nuovo. He would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never-before-emphasized aspects of love. Love for Beatrice would be his reason for writing poetry and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him constantly and providing spiritual instruction, sometimes harshly.\n\nParagraph 3:\nWhen Beatrice died in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin literature. The Convivio chronicles his having read Boethius's De consolatione philosophiae and Cicero's De Amicitia. He next dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in Santa Maria Novella.\n\nParagraph 4:\nAt around the age of 18, Dante met Guido Cavalcanti and Brunetto Latini; together they became the leaders of the dolce stil nuovo. He took part in the disputes that the two principal mendicant orders publicly or indirectly held in Florence. The former explaining the doctrines of the mystics and of St. Bonaventure, the latter expounding on the theories of St. Thomas Aquinas."

Fleischer Studios, headed by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer, had already released a number of sound cartoons using the DeForest system in the mid-1920s. However, these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film.\n\nParagraph 6: For Willie, Disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat. This precise timing is apparent during the \"Turkey in the Straw\" sequence when Mickey's actions exactly match the accompanying instruments.\n\nParagraph 7: Animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the film's original music. This role has been variously attributed to Wilfred Jackson, Carl Stalling and Bert Lewis, but identification remains uncertain.\n\nParagraph 8: Walt Disney himself was voice actor for both Mickey and Minnie and would remain the source of Mickey's voice through 1946 for theatrical cartoons."

Sales did not meet Nintendo's expectations, with 2.5 million units being sold by 2007. In mid-2005, the Nintendo World Store was inaugurated in New York City.\n\nParagraph 3:\nNintendo's next home console was conceived in 2001, although development commenced in 2003. Taking inspiration from the Nintendo DS and considering the relative failure of the GameCube, Nintendo opted to take a \"Blue Ocean Strategy\" by developing a reduced performance console in contrast to the high-performance consoles of Sony and Microsoft. The Wii was released in November 2006, with a total of 33 launch games.\n\nParagraph 4:\nWith the Wii, Nintendo sought to reach a broader demographic than its seventh-generation competitors, with the intention of also encompassing the \"non-consumer\" sector. To this end, Nintendo invested in a $200 million advertising campaign. The Wii's innovations include the Wii Remote controller, equipped with an accelerometer system and infrared sensors that allow it to detect its position in a three-dimensional environment with the aid of a sensor bar; the Nunchuk peripheral that includes an analog controller and an accelerometer; and the Wii MotionPlus expansion.\n\nParagraph 5:\nSeveral accessories were released for the Wii from 2007 to 2010, such as the Wii Balance Board, the Wii Wheel and the WiiWare download service. In 2009, Nintendo Iberica S.A. expanded its commercial operations to Portugal through a new office in Lisbon. By that year, Nintendo held a 68.3% share of the worldwide handheld gaming market.\n\nParagraph 6:\nIn 2010, Nintendo celebrated the 25th anniversary of Mario's debut appearance, for which certain allusive products were put on sale."

It has no single protagonist and opens with solicitor Jonathan Harker taking a business trip to stay at the castle of a Transylvanian nobleman, Count Dracula. Harker escapes the castle after discovering that Dracula is a vampire, and the Count moves to England and plagues the seaside town of Whitby. A small group, led by Abraham Van Helsing, investigates, hunts and kills Dracula.\n\nParagraph 2:\nDracula was mostly written in the 1890s. Stoker produced over a hundred pages of notes for the novel, drawing extensively from Transylvanian folklore and history. Some scholars have suggested that the character of Dracula was inspired by historical figures like the Wallachian prince Vlad the Impaler or the countess Elizabeth Báthory, but there is widespread disagreement. Stoker's notes mention neither figure. He found the name Dracula in Whitby's public library while on holiday, thinking it meant devil in Romanian.\n\nParagraph 3:\nFollowing its publication, Dracula was positively received by reviewers who pointed to its effective use of horror. In contrast, reviewers who wrote negatively of the novel regarded it as excessively frightening. Comparisons to other works of Gothic fiction were common, including its structural similarity to Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White (1859).\n\nParagraph 4:\nIn the past century, Dracula has been situated as a piece of Gothic fiction. Modern scholars explore the novel within its historical context—the Victorian era—and discuss its depiction of gender roles, sexuality, and race.\n\nParagraph 5:\nDracula is one of the most famous pieces of English literature. Many of the book's characters have entered popular culture as archetypal versions of their characters; for example, Count Dracula as the quintessential vampire, and Abraham Van Helsing as an iconic vampire hunter.\n\nParagraph 6:\nThe novel, which is in the public domain, has been adapted for film over 30 times, and its characters have made numerous appearances in virtually all media."

After the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1967, packet switching from the proposed NPL network was incorporated into the design of the ARPANET, an experimental resource sharing network proposed by ARPA.\n\nParagraph 3:\nARPANET development began with two network nodes which were interconnected between the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and SRI International (SRI) on 29 October 1969. The third site was at the University of California, Santa Barbara, followed by the University of Utah. In a sign of future growth, 15 sites were connected to the young ARPANET by the end of 1971.\n\nParagraph 4:\nThese early years were documented in the 1972 film Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing. Thereafter, the ARPANET gradually developed into a decentralized communications network, connecting remote centers and military bases in the United States. Other user networks and research networks, such as the Merit Network and CYCLADES, were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nParagraph 5:\nEarly international collaborations for the ARPANET were rare. Connections were made in 1973 to the Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR), and to Peter Kirstein's research group at University College London, which provided a gateway to British academic networks, forming the first internetwork for resource sharing.\n\nParagraph 6:\nARPA projects, international working groups and commercial initiatives led to the development of various protocols and standards by which multiple separate networks could become a single network or \"a network of networks\". In 1974, Vint Cerf at Stanford University and Bob Kahn at DARPA published a proposal for \"A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication\"."

The player collects Power Stars from the paintings in Peach's castle to unlock later courses and areas. The Nintendo 64's analog stick makes an extensive repertoire of precise movements in all directions possible.\n\nParagraph 4:\nThe game introduced moves such as punching, triple jumping, and using a Wing Cap to fly.

Mario must once again save Princess Peach from Bowser.\n\nParagraph 5:\nThe game's power-ups differ from previous games, now being three different hats with temporary powers: the Wing Cap, allowing Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, turning him into metal; and the Vanish Cap, allowing him to walk through obstacles. Super Mario 64 is considered seminal to 3D video games.\n\nParagraph 6:\nA remake of the game called Super Mario 64 DS was released for Nintendo DS in 2004 and 2005, adding Yoshi, Luigi, and Wario as playable characters, new abilities, new objectives, multiplayer, and minigames."

He is Jewish.\n\nParagraph 2: Allen's parents were Nettie (née Cherry; 1906–2002), a bookkeeper at her family's delicatessen, and Martin Konigsberg (1900–2001), a jewelry engraver and waiter. His grandparents were immigrants to the U.S. from Austria and the Lithuanian city of Panevėžys. They spoke German, Hebrew and Yiddish.\n\nParagraph 3: He and his younger sister, film producer Letty, were raised in Brooklyn's Midwood neighborhood. Both their parents were born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Allen's parents did not get along, and he had an estranged relationship with his authoritarian, ill-tempered mother.\n\nParagraph 4: He spoke German in his early years. He later joked that he was often sent to interfaith summer camps when he was young. While attending Hebrew school for eight years, he went to Public School 99 (now the Isaac Asimov School for Science and Literature) and Midwood High School, graduating in 1953.\n\nParagraph 5: Unlike his comic persona, he was more interested in baseball than school and his strong arm ensured he was picked first for teams. He impressed students with his talent for cards and magic tricks. Allen wrote jokes (or \"gags\") for agent David O. Alber to make money, and Alber sold them to newspaper columnists.\n\nParagraph 6: At age 17, he legally changed his name to Heywood Allen and later began to call himself Woody. According to Allen, his first published joke read: \"Woody Allen says he ate at a restaurant that had O.P.S. prices—over people's salaries.\" He was soon earning more than both of his parents combined.\n\nParagraph 7: After high school, he attended New York University, studying communication and film in 1953, before dropping out after failing the course \"Motion Picture Production\". He studied film at City College of New York in 1954, but left during the first semester. He taught himself rather than studying in the classroom."

Deciding to experiment with his own independence and freedom, Gautier chose to stay with friends in the Doyenné district of Paris.\n\nParagraph 3:\nTowards the end of 1830, Gautier began to frequent meetings of Le Petit Cénacle (The Little Upper Room), a group of artists who met in the studio of Jehan Du Seigneur. The group was a more irresponsible version of Hugo's Cénacle. Among its members were the artists Gérard de Nerval, Alexandre Dumas, père, Petrus Borel, Alphonse Brot, and Philothée O’Neddy. Le Petit Cénacle soon gained a reputation for extravagance and eccentricity.\n\nParagraph 4:\nGautier began writing poetry as early as 1826, but the majority of his life was spent as a contributor to various journals, mainly La Presse, which also gave him the opportunity for foreign travel and for meeting many influential contacts in high society and in the world of the arts.\n\nParagraph 5:\nThroughout his life, Gautier was well-traveled, taking trips to Spain, Italy, Russia, Egypt and Algeria. Gautier's many travels inspired many of his writings including Voyage en Espagne (1843), Trésors d’Art de la Russie (1858), and Voyage en Russie (1867).\n\nParagraph 6:\nGautier's travel literature is considered by many as being some of the best from the nineteenth century; often written in a personal style, it provides a window into Gautier's own tastes in art and culture.\n\nParagraph 7:\nGautier was a celebrated abandonné (one who yields or abandons himself to something) of the Romantic Ballet, writing several scenarios, the most famous of which is Giselle, whose first interpreter, the ballerina Carlotta Grisi, was the great love of his life."

His mother was Renée Chabot, daughter of Perceval Chabot and heiress of La Turmelière (Plus me plaît le séjour qu'ont bâti mes aïeux). Both his parents died while he was still a child, and he was left to the guardianship of his elder brother, René du Bellay.\n\nParagraph 2:\nWhen he was twenty-three, however, he received permission to study law at the University of Poitiers.

                "0": " Paragraph 1:\nJazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has roots in blues and ragtime and has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music since the 1920s. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms, and improvisation.\n\nParagraph 2:\nJazz has roots in European harmony and African rhythmic rituals. As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime, and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.\n\nParagraph 3:\nBut jazz did not begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles.\n\nParagraph 4:\nBebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music\" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.\n\nParagraph 5:\nThe mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat, and formal structures.\n\nParagraph 6:\nJazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay.\n\nParagraph 7:\nOther styles and genres abound in the 21st century, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz."

Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.\n\nParagraph 2:\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.\n\nParagraph 3:\nKnowledge bases need to represent things such as: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\n\nParagraph 4:\nAmong the most difficult problems in KR are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).\n\nParagraph 5:\nKnowledge acquisition is the difficult problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. Modern AI gathers knowledge by \"scraping\" the internet (including Wikipedia). The knowledge itself was collected by the volunteers and professionals who published the information (who may or may not have agreed to provide their work to AI companies).\n\nParagraph 6:\nThis \"crowd sourced\" technique does not guarantee that the knowledge is correct or reliable. The knowledge of Large Language Models (such as ChatGPT) is highly unreliable—it generates misinformation and falsehoods (known as \"hallucinations\"). Providing accurate knowledge for these modern AI applications is an unsolved problem."

Michaung originated as a low-pressure area in the Gulf of Thailand which crossed into the Bay of Bengal and became a deep depression on December 2. It developed into a cyclonic storm thereafter and was named Michaung.\n\nParagraph 2: The cyclone gradually moved north-west over the next few days towards the eastern coast of India. The storm peaked with sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) causing heavy rainfall in north-eastern Tamil Nadu including Chennai and south-eastern Andhra Pradesh before making landfall near Bapatla in Andhra Pradesh on December 5.\n\nParagraph 3: In late November 2023, a low-pressure area crossed into the Bay of Bengal from the Gulf of Thailand. On December 1, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the disturbance had developed into a depression in the South Andaman Sea, and was expected to move towards the northwest while strengthening in the Bay of Bengal.\n\nParagraph 4: On December 2, the system intensified into a deep depression located about 440 kilometres (270 mi) east-southeast of Puducherry. Thereafter, it intensified into a cyclonic storm, and was assigned the name Michaung by Myanmar.\n\nParagraph 5: On December 4, cyclone Michaung reached peak intensity as it approached the coast of Tamil Nadu with winds of 110 kilometres per hour (68 mph), equivalent to a high-end tropical storm on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Michaung moved almost directly northward along the coast.\n\nParagraph 6: On December 5, the storm made landfall between Nellore and Machilipatnam in Andhra Pradesh, weakening as it moved inland. By December 6, the storm had weakened to a depression over central Andhra Pradesh."

Impressed by this, Zappa responded by putting Vai on salary to transcribe his work, which included pieces from the Joe's Garage and Shut Up 'n Play Yar Guitar albums.\n\nParagraph 2: After leaving Berklee College of Music and moving to California, Vai auditioned for and became a full-time member of Zappa's band, going on his first tour with Zappa in late 1980. Zappa often referred to Vai as his \"little Italian virtuoso\", and Vai is frequently listed in the liner notes of Zappa's albums as having performed \"stunt\" or \"impossible\" guitar parts.\n\nParagraph 3: Vai was a featured artist on the 1993 release Zappa's Universe, and in 2006, Vai appeared as a special guest on Dweezil Zappa's Zappa Plays Zappa tour; both projects won Vai a Grammy Award.\n\nParagraph 4: After moving on from Zappa's employ in 1983, Vai bought a house in Sylmar, Los Angeles, where he built his first professional studio. During this period, Vai formed two bands (The Classified and 777) as well as writing and recording a large amount of music that was not originally intended for release.\n\nParagraph 5: Out of this material, Vai compiled his first studio album Flex-Able. He created his own record label, Akashic Records (later Light Without Heat Records), which he used to take Flex-Able directly to distribution channels.\n\nParagraph 6: Flex-Able was released in January 1984. Vai began his rise to public acclaim in 1983 when, shortly before the release of Flex-Able, his composition \"The Attitude Song\" was published in Guitar Player magazine.\n\nParagraph 7: The song centered itself on a main guitar riff in the time signature 7/16, played over a rhythm section centered in 4/4. Each following section of the song showcased a number of specialized techniques (such as two-handed tapping, whammy bar acrobatics, sweep picking, alternate picking, multi-part harmonies, and odd phrasing) used in angular and exaggerated ways that were unique to the song at the time."

The Latin phrase imperium sine fine (\"empire without end\") expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire. In Virgil's Aeneid, limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by Jupiter. This claim of universal dominion was renewed when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century.\n\nParagraph 2:\nIn addition to annexing large regions, the Romans directly altered their geography, for example cutting down entire forests. Roman expansion was mostly accomplished under the Republic, though parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century, when Roman control in Europe, Africa, and Asia was strengthened.\n\nParagraph 3:\nUnder Augustus, a \"global map of the known world\" was displayed for the first time in public at Rome, coinciding with the creation of the most comprehensive political geography that survives from antiquity, the Geography of Strabo. When Augustus died, the account of his achievements (Res Gestae) prominently featured the geographical cataloguing of the Empire. Geography alongside meticulous written records were central concerns of Roman Imperial administration.\n\nParagraph 4:\nThe Empire reached its largest expanse under Trajan (r. 98–117), encompassing 5 million square kilometres. The traditional population estimate of 55–60 million inhabitants accounted for between one-sixth and one-fourth of the world's total population and made it the most populous unified political entity in the West until the mid-19th century. Recent demographic studies have argued for a population peak from 70 million to more than 100 million.\n\nParagraph 5:\nEach of the three largest cities in the Empire – Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch – was almost twice the size of any European city at the beginning of the 17th century. Trajan's successor Hadrian adopted a policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines) were marked, and the frontiers (limites) patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable."

Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing.\n\nParagraph 3: Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia in lunar orbit, and they were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin Columbia.\n\nParagraph 4: Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC. It was the fifth crewed mission of NASA's Apollo program.\n\nParagraph 5: The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.\n\nParagraph 6: After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20.\n\nParagraph 7: The astronauts used Eagle's ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth."

On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier to 1900 BC.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage; the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink. An early Classic-period (460–480 AD) Maya tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, which suggests that the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD.\n\nParagraph 3:\nDocuments in Maya hieroglyphs stated that chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes in addition to everyday life. The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.\n\nParagraph 4:\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs had gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and had adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans, and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.\n\nParagraph 5:\nIn contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chili pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\n\nParagraph 6:\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire. Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed \"tribute\"."

In addition to a zone 8 climate or warmer, tea plants require at least 127 cm (50 in) of rainfall per year and prefer acidic soils. Many high-quality tea plants are cultivated at elevations of up to 1,500 m (4,900 ft) above sea level.\n\nParagraph 3:\nThough at these heights the plants grow more slowly, they acquire a better flavour. Two principal varieties are used: Camellia sinensis var. sinensis, which is used for most Chinese, Formosan and Japanese teas, and C. sinensis var. assamica, used in Pu-erh and most Indian teas (but not Darjeeling). Within these botanical varieties, many strains and modern clonal varieties are known.\n\nParagraph 4:\nLeaf size is the chief criterion for the classification of tea plants, with three primary classifications being: Assam type, characterised by the largest leaves; China type, characterised by the smallest leaves; and Cambodian type, characterised by leaves of intermediate size. The Cambodian-type tea (C. assamica subsp. lasiocaly) was originally considered a type of Assam tea. However, later genetic work showed that it is a hybrid between Chinese small-leaf tea and Assam-type tea.

Adult males occasionally venture outside their home ranges; when they do so, dominant ones retain their status.\n\nParagraph 3:\nAs a male climbs a new tree, he rubs his chest against it and sometimes dribbles urine.

After a near-miss in 1927, Lambeau's squad claimed the Packers' first NFL title in 1929 with an undefeated 12–0–1 campaign, behind a stifling defense which registered eight shutouts.\n\nParagraph 4: Green Bay repeated as league champions in 1930 and 1931, bettering teams from New York, Chicago and throughout the league, with all-time greats and future Hall of Famers Mike Michalske, Johnny (Blood) McNally, Cal Hubbard and Green Bay native Arnie Herber. Among the many impressive accomplishments of these years was the Packers' streak of 29 consecutive home games without defeat, an NFL record which still stands.\n\nParagraph 5: The arrival of end Don Hutson from Alabama in 1935 gave Lambeau and the Packers the most-feared and dynamic offensive weapon in the game. Credited with inventing pass patterns, Hutson led the league in receptions eight seasons and spurred the Packers to NFL championships in 1936, 1939 and 1944.\n\nParagraph 6: An iron man, Hutson played both ways, leading the league in interceptions as a safety in 1940. Hutson claimed 18 NFL records when he retired in 1945, many of which still stand."

                "0": " Paragraph 1:\nAlthough the term domain did not come into use until the mid-18th century, the concept can be traced back to ancient Roman law. The Romans had a large proprietary rights system where they defined \"many things that cannot be privately owned\" as res nullius, res communes, res publicae and res universitatis.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe term res nullius was defined as things not yet appropriated. The term res communes was defined as \"things that could be commonly enjoyed by mankind, such as air, sunlight and ocean.\" The term res publicae referred to things that were shared by all citizens, and the term res universitatis meant things that were owned by the municipalities of Rome.\n\nParagraph 3:\nFrom a historical perspective, one could say the construction of the idea of \"public domain\" sprouted from the concepts of res communes, res publicae, and res universitatis in early Roman law.\n\nParagraph 4:\nWhen the first early copyright law was originally established in Britain with the Statute of Anne in 1710, public domain did not appear. However, similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the 18th century.\n\nParagraph 5:\nInstead of \"public domain\", they used terms such as publici juris or propriété publique to describe works that were not covered by copyright law. The phrase \"fall in the public domain\" can be traced to mid-19th-century France to describe the end of copyright term.\n\nParagraph 6:\nThe French poet Alfred de Vigny equated the expiration of copyright with a work falling \"into the sink hole of public domain.\" If the public domain receives any attention from intellectual property lawyers it is still treated as little more than that which is left when intellectual property rights, such as copyright, patents, and trademarks, expire or are abandoned.\n\nParagraph 7:\nIn this historical context, Paul Torremans describes copyright as a, \"little coral reef of private right jutting up from the ocean of the public domain.\" Copyright law differs by country, and the American legal scholar Pamela Samuelson has described the public domain as being \"different sizes at different times in different countries\"."

It became the first doctor's office in Green Bay that was not located in the downtown area.\n\nParagraph 2: Brusky worked his entire medical career at the West Side Clinic, where he practiced a broad range of medicine that included delivering babies, orthopedics and surgery, before retiring in 1987. During his career, he worked with the local Catholic diocese to move and re-establish St. Mary's Hospital in Green Bay.\n\nParagraph 3: In 1962, Brusky was hired by the Green Bay Packers to be the team physician. He was hired after another doctor, Mason LeTellier, gave a recommendation to Packers head coach Vince Lombardi while they were golfing.\n\nParagraph 4: Lombardi noted to LeTellier that his players were seeing numerous doctors, who all had differing opinions regarding injuries and ailments. LeTellier told Lombardi to talk with Brusky, who Lombardi had golfed with before at the Oneida Golf and Riding Club.\n\nParagraph 5: Lombardi met with Brusky the next day and hired him, although for almost ten years the position was unpaid, with Brusky only being reimbursed for expenses. Brusky set-up his own office, which included an x-ray machine.\n\nParagraph 6: Brusky continued in this role for 29 years before retiring in 1990 as the longest tenured team physician in the NFL. Before his retirement, he trained his replacement, Clarence Novotny, who he had worked with at the West Side Clinic; he provided some assistance to Novotny during the 1991 NFL season.\n\nParagraph 7: Brusky was embroiled in a small controversy just prior to his retirement. Don Majkowski, the Packers' quarterback, suffered a shoulder injury in a game during the 1990 NFL season. Brusky cleared Majkowski to play, however when Majkowski attempted to throw the ball he said he was in too much pain to play.\n\nParagraph 8: Brusky made public comments saying that Majkowski was clear to play, however after a second opinion, a tear was found in Majkowski's rotator cuff and he had surgery and was out for the rest of the season."

After the Ottoman Empire colonialised Constantinople in 1453, the sea routes discovered by Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator became central to trade, and helped fuel the Age of Discovery. The Crown of Castile encountered the Americas in 1492 through sea travel and built trading posts or conquered large extents of land. The Treaty of Tordesillas divided the areas of these \"new\" lands between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire in 1494.\n\nParagraph 2: The 17th century saw the birth of the Dutch Empire and French colonial empire, as well as the English overseas possessions, which later became the British Empire. It also saw the establishment of Danish overseas colonies and Swedish overseas colonies. A first wave of separatism started with the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), initiating the Rise of the \"Second\" British Empire (1783-1815). The Spanish Empire largely collapsed in the Americas with the Spanish American wars of independence (1808-1833).\n\nParagraph 3: Empire-builders established several new colonies after this time, including in the German colonial empire and Belgian colonial empire. Starting with the end of the French Revolution European authors such as Johann Gottfried Herder, August von Kotzebue, and Heinrich von Kleist prolifically published so as to conjure up sympathy for the oppressed native peoples and the slaves of the new world, thereby starting the idealization of native humans.\n\nParagraph 4: The Habsburg monarchy, the Russian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire existed at the same time but did not expand over oceans. Rather, these empires expanded through the conquest of neighbouring territories. There was, though, some Russian colonization of North America across the Bering Strait.\n\nParagraph 5: From the 1860s onwards the Empire of Japan modelled itself on European colonial empires and expanded its territories in the Pacific and on the Asian mainland. The Empire of Brazil fought for hegemony in South America. The United States gained overseas territories after the 1898 Spanish–American War, hence, the coining of the term \"American imperialism\".\n\nParagraph 6: In the late 19th century many European powers became involved in the Scramble for Africa."

A total of four volcanic eruptions have occurred in the Reykjanes Peninsula since 2021.\n\nParagraph 8:\nThe 2023 earthquake swarm is associated with a magmatic intrusion estimated to be up to 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) long that runs in a south-westerly direction, starting at Kálfellsheiði [ˈkʰaulˌfɛlsˌheiːðɪ] and following the line of the Sundhnúkur [ˈsʏntˌn̥uːkʏr̥] crater chain at a depth of around 800 metres (2,600 ft).\n\nParagraph 9:\nThe largest of the earthquakes originated under the Sundhnúkur craters but subsequently propagated south-west under Grindavík and into the sea. The town stands on lava erupted from Sundhnúkur around 2,350 years ago.\n\nParagraph 10:\nIt is one of six communities on the peninsula that are situated on or near an eruptive fissure."

He was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln, an Englishman who migrated from Hingham, Norfolk, to its namesake, Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1638.\n\nParagraph 2: The family then migrated west, passing through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Lincoln was also a descendant of the Harrison family of Virginia; his paternal grandfather and namesake, Captain Abraham Lincoln and wife Bathsheba (née Herring), moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County, Kentucky.\n\nParagraph 3: The captain was killed in an Indian raid in 1786. His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, Abraham's father, witnessed the attack. Thomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and Tennessee before the family settled in Hardin County, Kentucky, in the early 1800s.\n\nParagraph 4: Lincoln's mother Nancy Lincoln is widely assumed to be the daughter of Lucy Hanks. Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to Elizabethtown, Kentucky. They had three children: Sarah, Abraham, and Thomas, who died as an infant.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1816, the family moved to Indiana where the land surveys and titles were more reliable. Indiana was a \"free\" (non-slaveholding) territory, and they settled in an \"unbroken forest\" in Hurricane Township, Perry County, Indiana.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was \"partly on account of slavery\", but mainly due to land title difficulties.\n\nParagraph 7: In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter. At various times, he owned farms, livestock, and town lots, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, and served on county patrols.\n\nParagraph 8: Thomas and Nancy were members of a Separate Baptists church, which forbade alcohol, dancing, and slavery. Overcoming financial challenges, Thomas in 1827 obtained clear title to 80 acres (32 ha) in Indiana, an area which became the Little Pigeon Creek Community."

The storm saw structural damage occur across nearly all counties of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with the worst hit areas in a band from Ulster across the Irish Sea to Lancashire and down through the Midlands into East Anglia.\n\nParagraph 2: Wind speeds of over 40 m/s (140 km/h; 89 mph) were recorded at a number of stations in England, with RAF Wittering in Cambridgeshire recording a gust of 47 m/s (169 km/h; 105 mph) at 22:18 GMT on 2 January.

Strong gale or storm force was often reached with hurricane force 12 reported from some places in South Wales, southwest and northern England, with Middlesbrough experiencing 51 m/s (183 km/h; 114 mph) winds.\n\nParagraph 3: In mainland Britain, railways were severely affected as overhead power supplies collapsed in the Midlands. A light aircraft was blown onto the railway from the ground at Southend Airport, causing disruption on the line. Damages were also incurred at Manchester Ringway Airport (now Manchester Airport), where runway approach lighting masts were bent and buckled by the wind. The high winds brought down a crane in central Manchester.\n\nParagraph 4: The high winds blew a beech tree onto the elephant house of Longleat Safari Park causing estimated damage of US$20,000. The elephants Twiggy and Chiki escaped unharmed and were later put to work pulling the remains of the tree from their home. One of the pinnacles of the main tower of Worcester Cathedral crashed through the roof into the transept during the storm.\n\nParagraph 5: There were prolonged power outages in Norfolk, with power being cut to over 100,000 in the three counties of Kent, Surrey and Sussex to the south of London. The Old Vic theatre in London was evacuated as strong winds brought down scaffolding surrounding the venue.

The police conducted a detailed search of the entire forest with hundreds of officers, while a special task force was set up in order to find the perpetrator.\n\nParagraph 2:\nOn 20 December, police said that they had no leads in the case but were continuing to search for the perpetrator. The firearms website zbrojnice.com noted a similarity of the case with the 2005 \"Forest Killer\" murders, in which a former police officer killed three random victims in forests in preparation for a planned mass murder in the Prague Metro, which was prevented by his early arrest; the article ended with an appeal to readers to remain vigilant and carry their concealed firearms.\n\nParagraph 3:\nFive hours after the attack at Charles University, the police released information that they had found evidence in David Kozák's house linking him to the Klánovice Forest murders.\n\nParagraph 4:\nAt a press conference on 22 December, the chief detective of Prague's 1st General Crime Unit stated that Kozák had been one of about 4,000 suspects in the Klánovice Forest case. However, because he lived in the Central Bohemian Region, they were a few days short of being able to prevent the shootings.\n\nParagraph 5:\nLater that day, the police confirmed that a firearm found at Kozák's house had been ballistically matched with the bullets used in the Klánovice Forest murders.\n\nParagraph 6:\nOn 21 December 2023 at 12:20 CET, the Central Bohemian Police were alerted by Kozák's mother, who said she had received a message from a friend that her son was planning to take his own life and that he was en route from his hometown of Hostouň to Prague.\n\nParagraph 7:\nAt 12:45, the police found the body of Kozák's father in his home."

He then worked for WHO radio in Des Moines as a broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs. Simultaneously, he often expressed his opposition to racism.\n\nParagraph 2: In 1936, while traveling with the Cubs to their spring training in California, Reagan took a screen test that led to a seven-year contract with Warner Bros. Reagan arrived at Hollywood in 1937, debuting in Love Is on the Air (1937). Using a simple and direct approach to acting and following his directors' instructions, Reagan made thirty films, mostly B films, before beginning military service in April 1942.\n\nParagraph 3: He broke out of these types of films by portraying George Gipp in Knute Rockne, All American (1940), which would be rejuvenated when reporters called Reagan \"the Gipper\" while he campaigned for president of the United States. Afterward, Reagan starred in Kings Row (1942) as a leg amputee, asking, \"Where's the rest of me?\" His performance was considered his best by many critics.\n\nParagraph 4: Reagan became a star, with Gallup polls placing him \"in the top 100 stars\" from 1941 to 1942. World War II interrupted the movie stardom that Reagan would never be able to achieve again as Warner Bros. became uncertain about his ability to generate ticket sales.\n\nParagraph 5: Reagan, who had a limited acting range, was dissatisfied with the roles he received. As a result, Lew Wasserman renegotiated his contract with his studio, allowing him to also make films with Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, and RKO Pictures as a freelancer. With this, Reagan appeared in multiple western films, something that had been denied to him while working at Warner Bros.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1952, he ended his relationship with Warner Bros., but went on to appear in a total of 53 films, his last being The Killers (1964)."

The overall operation was led by Maj Gen. Jagath Jayasuriya, the Wanni Security Forces Commander.\n\nParagraph 2: Both divisions advanced from the west of the country, with 57 Division approaching Kilinochchi from the south and west while Task Force 1 advanced further northwards, capturing other key LTTE strongholds in order to converge on Kilinochchi from the north. By early October, Kilinochchi had been vacated by its residents and units of the Kilinochchi hospital, banks and several government institutions were relocated at Tharmapuram, a village 13 kilometres (8 mi) away.\n\nParagraph 3: 57 Division, led by Maj. Gen. Jagath Dias, captured Akkarayankulam on 18 October 2008, a large village located to the southwest of Kilinochchi. The capture of this village enabled the SLA to attack Kilinochchi from the southwest. The Iranamadu junction, located to the south of Kilinochchi, was captured later, enabling the SLA to advance towards Kilinochchi from the south.\n\nParagraph 4: Troops from the 57 Division earlier captured several LTTE strongholds such as Adampan and Kokavil. Task Force 1, led by Brig. Shavendra Silva, advanced along the western coast, capturing several strategically important locations including the Mannar \"Rice Bowl\" area, Viddathalthivu, and Nachchikuda.\n\nParagraph 5: Task Force 1 launched an attack on Pooneryn on 15 November 2008, spearheaded by troops from the 2nd and 3rd Commando Regiments and a squadron of Special Forces, and captured the area. From there, Task Force 1 moved west and captured Paranthan on 31 December 2008, enabling the SLA to attack Kilinochchi from the north.\n\nParagraph 6: The LTTE used their self-styled \"Ditch-cum-bund\" strategy to defend the town and constructed earth bunds and trenches around the area in an \"L\" shape to halt the advance of the Sri Lankan military. One such earth bund was constructed to the south. Another stretched across the B69 Pooneryn-Paranthan road, along the western side of the town."

However, they failed. The United States contacted Zelenskyy and offered to help him flee the country, but he responded, \"The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from Belarus gained control of the ghost town of Chernobyl. Russian Airborne Forces attempted to seize two key airfields near Kyiv, launching an airborne assault on Antonov Airport, and a similar landing at Vasylkiv, near Vasylkiv Air Base, on 26 February.\n\nParagraph 4: By early March, Russian advances along the west side of the Dnipro were limited by Ukrainian defences. As of 5 March, a large Russian convoy, reportedly 64 kilometres (40 mi) long, had made little progress toward Kyiv. The London-based think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) assessed Russian advances from the north and east as \"stalled.\"\n\nParagraph 5: Advances from Chernihiv largely halted as a siege began there.

This incident remains the deadliest civilian aviation accident in Finnish history.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe investigation revealed that both pilots were intoxicated and should not have been flying. The Douglas DC-3 aircraft, registered OH-LCC, was scheduled for take-off from Kronoby Airport at 07:00 but departed late at 07:16. The co-pilot requested free flying altitude from the air traffic control, which was granted.\n\nParagraph 3:\nThis permission allowed Flight 311 to fly above the minimum flight altitude for the Kronoby-Vaasa route, which was 1,500 feet (460 m). However, the pilots did not adhere to these regulations during the last 40 kilometres (25 mi), flying below 100 metres (330 ft).\n\nParagraph 4:\nShortly after the flight's last radio contact with the air traffic control, in which the pilots confirmed the weather report and stated they would be at the Seppä non-directional radio beacon soon, Flight 311 began preparing for landing by descending below 50 metres (160 ft). Suddenly, the plane turned abruptly to the left.\n\nParagraph 5:\nThe pilots attempted to correct the situation by applying full throttle but were unsuccessful. The plane went into a spin, and eyewitnesses on the ground saw the pilots turn on the landing lights before the plane crashed into the woods at 07:40:30 in a steep 70-degree turn.\n\nParagraph 6:\nFirst responders arrived at the crash site ten minutes after the accident but were unable to rescue anyone due to intense flames reaching over 15 metres (49 ft) in height.

After this comes \"Robin Hood and the Potter,\" contained in a manuscript of c. 1503.\n\nParagraph 3:\n\"The Potter\" is markedly different in tone from \"The Monk\": whereas the earlier tale is \"a thriller,\" the latter is more comic, its plot involving trickery and cunning rather than straightforward force.\n\nParagraph 4:\nOther early texts are dramatic pieces, the earliest being the fragmentary Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham (c. 1475). These are particularly noteworthy as they show Robin's integration into May Day rituals towards the end of the Middle Ages; among other points of interest, Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham contains the earliest reference to Friar Tuck.\n\nParagraph 5:\nThe plots of neither \"the Monk\" nor \"the Potter\" are included in the Gest; and neither is the plot of \"Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne,\" which is probably at least as old as those two ballads although preserved in a more recent copy.\n\nParagraph 6:\nEach of these three ballads survived in a single copy, so it is unclear how much of the medieval legend has survived, and what has survived may not be typical of the medieval legend.

While stationed in New York, he became acquainted with Alexander Hamilton, and was appreciated for his engineering abilities. He reportedly was well-liked by George Washington, who would serve as a political inspiration for Badlam throughout his life.\n\nParagraph 2: He was appointed to major and transferred to service as an artillery commander under General Richard Montgomery in his invasion of Quebec, sailing north along the Hudson River. Following the invasion's failure, he returned to Fort Crown Point.\n\nParagraph 3: On July 4, 1776, he captured a fortified Vermont hill near Ticonderoga, and on July 18 named it Mount Independence, a name later confirmed by General Horatio Gates. There, he had helped and directed the building of fortifications in the region.\n\nParagraph 4: During his service, he met the Marquis de Lafayette, who granted Badlam a sword. After fighting at Fort Stanwix under Colonel Marinus Willett in August 1777, Badlam fell under a serious fever. Gravely ill and unable to serve military duties, physicians considered his recovery unlikely, and he resigned service to return to Dorchester.\n\nParagraph 5: While ill, he reported to have undergone an intense religious experience and prayed for his recovery.

This caused the ship to list and then to partially sink, landing unevenly on an underwater ledge.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAlthough a six-hour rescue effort brought most of the passengers ashore, 33 people died: 27 passengers, five crew, and, later, a member of the salvage team. An investigation focused on shortcomings in the procedures followed by Costa Concordia's crew and the actions of her captain, Francesco Schettino, who left the ship prematurely. He left about 300 passengers on board the sinking vessel, most of whom were rescued by helicopter or motorboats in the area.\n\nParagraph 3:\nSchettino was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Despite receiving its own share of criticism, Costa Cruises and its parent company, Carnival Corporation, did not face criminal charges. Costa Concordia was declared a \"constructive total loss\" by the cruise line's insurer, and her salvage was \"one of the biggest maritime salvage operations\".\n\nParagraph 4:\nOn 16 September 2013, the parbuckle salvage of the ship began, and by the early hours of 17 September, the ship was set upright on her underwater cradle.

Costa Cruises offered compensation to passengers (to a limit of €11,000 per person) to pay for all damages, including the value of the cruise; one third of the survivors took the offer."

Upon both entering and tying for first place in a scientific contest at the University of Paris, Johann, unable to bear the \"shame\" of being compared Daniel's equal, banned Daniel from his house. Johann Bernoulli also plagiarized some key ideas from Daniel's book Hydrodynamica in his own book Hydraulica which he backdated to before Hydrodynamica. Despite Daniel's attempts at reconciliation, his father carried the grudge until his death.\n\nParagraph 3:\nAround schooling age, his father, Johann Bernoulli, encouraged him to study business, there being poor rewards awaiting a mathematician. However, Daniel refused and later gave in to his father's wish and studied business. His father then asked him to study medicine, and Daniel agreed under the condition that his father would teach him mathematics privately, which they continued for some time.\n\nParagraph 4:\nDaniel studied medicine at Basel, Heidelberg, and Strasbourg, and earned a PhD in anatomy and botany in 1721.

The name \"Jura\" is derived from the Celtic root *jor via Gaulish *iuris \"wooded mountain,\" which was borrowed into Latin as a name of a place and evolved into Juria and finally Jura.\n\nParagraph 2:\nDuring a tour of the region in 1795, German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt recognized carbonate deposits within the Jura Mountains as geologically distinct from the Triassic aged Muschelkalk of southern Germany. He then named them Jura-Kalkstein ('Jura limestone') in 1799.\n\nParagraph 3:\nIn 1829, the French naturalist Alexandre Brongniart published a book entitled Description of the Terrains that Constitute the Crust of the Earth or Essay on the Structure of the Known Lands of the Earth. In this book, Brongniart used the phrase terrains jurassiques when correlating the \"Jura-Kalkstein\" of Humboldt with similarly aged oolitic limestones in Britain, thus coining and publishing the term \"Jurassic.\"\n\nParagraph 4:\nThe German geologist Leopold von Buch established the three-fold division of the Jurassic, originally named from oldest to youngest: the Black Jurassic, Brown Jurassic, and White Jurassic. The term \"Lias\" had previously been used for strata of equivalent age to the Black Jurassic in England by William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822.\n\nParagraph 5:\nThe French palaeontologist Alcide d'Orbigny divided the Jurassic into ten stages based on ammonite and other fossil assemblages in England and France, of which seven are still used, but none has retained its original definition.\n\nParagraph 6:\nThe German geologist and palaeontologist Friedrich August von Quenstedt divided the three series of von Buch in the Swabian Jura into six subdivisions defined by ammonites and other fossils.\n\nParagraph 7:\nThe German palaeontologist Albert Oppel altered d'Orbigny's original scheme and further subdivided the stages into biostratigraphic zones, based primarily on ammonites. Most of the modern stages of the Jurassic were formalized at the Colloque du Jurassique à Luxembourg in 1962."

Cabot sailed in 1497 and made landfall on the coast of Newfoundland, believing he had reached Asia. No attempt was made to found a colony.\n\nParagraph 2:\nNo further attempts to establish English colonies in the Americas were made until well into the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, during the last decades of the 16th century. In 1533, Henry VIII's Statute in Restraint of Appeals declared \"that this realm of England is an Empire.\" The Protestant Reformation turned England and Catholic Spain into implacable enemies.\n\nParagraph 3:\nIn 1562, Elizabeth I encouraged privateers John Hawkins and Francis Drake to engage in slave-raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa with the aim of establishing an Atlantic slave trade. This effort was rebuffed, and as the Anglo-Spanish Wars intensified, Elizabeth I gave her blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping returning across the Atlantic laden with treasure from the New World.\n\nParagraph 4:\nAt the same time, influential writers such as Richard Hakluyt and John Dee (the first to use the term \"British Empire\") were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own empire. By this time, Spain had become the dominant power in the Americas and was exploring the Pacific Ocean, Portugal had established trading posts and forts from the coasts of Africa and Brazil to China, and France had begun to settle the Saint Lawrence River area, later to become New France."

Causes of the distribution of the lunar highlands on the far side are also not well understood.\n\nParagraph 6: Topological measurements show the near side crust is thinner than the far side.

Dickens, aged 12, was forced to pawn his collection of books, leave school and work at a dirty and rat-infested shoe-blacking factory. The change in circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, describes as a \"deep personal and social outrage,\" which heavily influenced his writing and outlook.\n\nParagraph 2:\nBy the end of 1842, Dickens was a well-established author with six major works as well as several short stories, novellas and other pieces. On 31 December that year, he began publishing his novel Martin Chuzzlewit as a monthly serial; it was his favorite work, but sales were disappointing and he faced temporary financial difficulties.\n\nParagraph 3:\nCelebrating the Christmas season had been growing in popularity through the Victorian era.

It was completed in 1801 and dedicated in 1802 to his pupil Countess Julie \"Giulietta\" Guicciardi. The name Moonlight Sonata (German: Mondscheinsonate) grew popular later, likely after Beethoven's death.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe piece is one of Beethoven's most popular compositions for the piano, and it was a popular favourite even in his own day. Beethoven wrote the Moonlight Sonata in his early thirties, after he had finished with some commissioned work; there is no evidence that he was commissioned to write this sonata.\n\nParagraph 3:\nThe first edition of the score is headed Sonata quasi una fantasia (\"sonata almost a fantasy\"), the same title as that of its companion piece, Op. 27, No. 1. Grove Music Online translates the Italian title as \"sonata in the manner of a fantasy\". The subtitle reminds listeners that the piece, although technically a sonata, is suggestive of a free-flowing, improvised fantasia.\n\nParagraph 4:\nThe sonata consists of three movements: Adagio sostenuto, Allegretto, Presto agitato. The first movement, in C♯ minor and alla breve, is written in modified sonata-allegro form. Donald Francis Tovey warned players of this movement to avoid \"taking [it] on a quaver standard like a slow 12/8\".\n\nParagraph 5:\nThe movement opens with an octave in the left hand and a triplet figuration in the right. A melody that Hector Berlioz called a \"lamentation\", mostly by the left hand, is played against an accompanying ostinato triplet rhythm, simultaneously played by the right hand. The movement is played pianissimo (pp) or \"very quietly\", and the loudest it gets is piano (p) or \"quietly\".\n\nParagraph 6:\nThe adagio sostenuto tempo has made a powerful impression on many listeners. In his book Beethoven's pianoforte sonatas, the renowned pianist Edwin Fischer suggests that this movement of this sonata is based on Mozart's \"Ah Soccorso!

It is derived from the Albanian Tosk spoken in Albania, in Epirus and is also spoken by the Arvanites, with endonym Arvanitika.\n\nParagraph 2:\nArbëresh derives from a medieval variety of Tosk, which was spoken in southern Albania and from which the modern Tosk is also derived. It follows a similar evolutionary pattern to Arvanitika, a similar language spoken in Greece.\n\nParagraph 3:\nArbëresh is spoken in Southern Italy in the regions of Abruzzi, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Molise, Apulia and Sicily. The varieties of Arbëresh are closely related to each other but are not always entirely mutually intelligible.\n\nParagraph 4:\nThe varieties of Arbëresh largely correspond with the regions where they are spoken, while some settlements have distinctive features that result in greater or lesser degrees of mutual intelligibility.\n\nParagraph 5:\nThe Siculo-Arbëresh variety is spoken exclusively in the Province of Palermo and in three villages: Piana degli Albanesi, Santa Cristina Gela and Contessa Entellina; while the varieties of Piana and Santa Cristina Gela are similar enough to be entirely mutually intelligible, the variety of Contessa Entellina is not entirely intelligible.\n\nParagraph 6:\nTherefore a further dialect within Siculo-Arbëresh known as the Palermitan-Arbëresh variety can be identified, as well as a Cosenza variety, a Basilicata variety, and a Campania variety represented by the speech of one single settlement of Greci.\n\nParagraph 7:\nThere is also a Molisan-Arbëresh and an Apulio-Arbëresh. Within the Cosenza Calabrian varieties of Arbëresh, the dialect of Vaccarizzo Albanese is particularly distinct.\n\nParagraph 8:\nSpoken in the villages of Vaccarizzo Albanese and San Giorgio Albanese in Calabria by approximately 3,000 people, Vaccarizzo Albanian has retained many archaic features of both Gheg and Tosk dialects."

He is best known for his novel Don Quixote, a work often cited as both the first modern novel and \"the first great novel of world literature\".\n\nParagraph 2:\nHis first significant novel, titled La Galatea, was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, and later as a government tax collector. Part One of Don Quixote was published in 1605, and Part Two in 1615.\n\nParagraph 3:\nOther works include the 12 Novelas ejemplares (Exemplary Novels); a long poem, the Viaje del Parnaso (Journey to Parnassus); and Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses (Eight Plays and Eight Interludes). The novel Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda, was published posthumously in 1616.\n\nParagraph 4:\nCervantes is generally considered a mediocre poet; few of his poems survive. Some appear in La Galatea, while he also wrote Dos Canciones à la Armada Invencible. His sonnets include Al Túmulo del Rey Felipe en Sevilla, Canto de Calíope and Epístola a Mateo Vázquez.\n\nParagraph 5:\nViaje del Parnaso, or Journey to Parnassus, is his most ambitious verse work, an allegory that consists largely of reviews of contemporary poets. He published a number of dramatic works, including ten extant full-length plays: Trato de Argel; based on his own experiences, deals with the life of Christian slaves in Algiers; La Numancia; intended as a patriotic work, dramatization of the long and brutal siege of Numantia, by Scipio Aemilianus, completing the transformation of the Iberian peninsula into the Roman province Hispania, or España.\n\nParagraph 6:\nEl gallardo español, Los baños de Argel, La gran sultana, Doña Catalina de Oviedo, La casa de los celos, El laberinto de amor, La entretenida, El rufián dichoso, and Pedro de Urdemalas.

                "0": " Paragraph 1:\nThe manuscript 1153 of Yale’s Beinecke Library contains at folios 144v-145r a brief report of the journey to the Holy Land, made in 1383 by Franceschinus cimator de Pontremulo, a humble cloth remover from Pontremoli. The only work by Franceschino that is still extant today is this brief itinerarium.\n\nParagraph 2:\nIt retraces the stages of the pilgrim’s journey to the Holy Land, starting from Pontremoli on 18 February 1383. The route undertaken by Franceschino turns out to be, at least in its initial part, an anomalous one: although the cimator was close to Genoa, he decides to set sail from Venice to reach the Holy Land, passing through Rome, the second stage of his journey.\n\nParagraph 3:\nFranceschino tells us that Rome is 300 terrestrial miles away from Pontremoli, about 480 km. Indeed this is a rather precise indication, since the real distance between Pontremoli and Rome is about 450 km: \"Ego Franceschinus cimator de Pontremulo discessi causa eundi in Yerusalem ad visitandum illa sancta loca, et sic ivi Romam in die XVI, ubi distant milliaria CCC per terram\".\n\nParagraph 4:\nIt is likely that the cimator, in order to reach Rome, followed the route of the Via Francigena, which, as it is well-known, passes through Pontremoli. Franceschino claims that it took him 16 days to reach Rome: he arrived on 5 March and left 13 days later, on 18 March: \"Die XVIIIa Martii discessi Roma et hospitatus fui 'a la' villa, ubi distant milliaria XVIIIa\".\n\nParagraph 5:\nThe villa where Franceschino stayed must have been on the Via Salaria, the way which he probably followed on his way from Rome to Rieti. It is likely that Franceschino stopped in Rome to visit the city: Rome, the second holy city for the Christian world, certainly was an important destination for pilgrims.\n\nParagraph 6:\nThe pilgrimage to Rome, which was less challenging than the pilgrimage to the Holy Land, was no less important from a spiritual point of view, as a place of worship of the early martyrs and a papal centre involved in dispensing indulgences."
