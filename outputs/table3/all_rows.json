Among the others, the Aspidochelone (or Fastitocalon), a creature similar to an island; the bishop-fish (also known as the sea bishop, sea monk or monk-fish), a sea monster whose legend might also have originated from encounters with seals, sharks or walruses; and, even the biblical Leviathan. Myth around these creatures has lived at least up to mid 1800 and is still alive in some cultures. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (fourth century BC), in his work \"The history of animals\", distinguished the common squid (teuthis) from its larger and rarer cousin (teuthus or, in some translations, teuthos), which could reach 2.3m in length. Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (first century AD), in his work \"Natural history\", described a giant squid, which had a body “as large as a barrel” and tentacles reaching 9.1m in length. Curiously, In Pliny's (as well as in Aristotle's) works, the giant squid was treated as a common animal and did not belong to myths of their ages. However, some later authors, especially in fictional literature, made this mistake. In fact, the Kraken’s legend originated from sailors’ accounts dating from a millennium after the age of Pliny. The legend of the Kraken was born from seamen’s stories, but it was much modified and strengthened over the years. Right from the start, the Kraken was universally incorporated into Nordic mythology and folklore. According to an obscure, ancient manuscript of circa 1180 by King Sverre of Norway, the Kraken was just one of many sea monsters. Still, it had its own peculiarities: it was colossal in size, as large as an island, and capable of sinking ships; it haunted the seas between Norway and Iceland, and between Iceland and Greenland."

Bruni, who in those years held the post of apostolic secretary on behalf of Pope John XXIII, headed to the German city along with the entourage of curials in the pontiff's service to attend the work of the Council, which met in Constance to reestablish the unity of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches and thus end the Western Schism. In order to reach Pope John XXIII, who made his entrance in Constance as early as October 28, Bruni had to move from Rome with the other members of the Curia a few weeks later, for in the letter he states that he arrived in Verona on November 27 («Veronam ad V Kalendas Decembris cum satis mane venissem») and stayed there for two days, during which he had the opportunity to admire some of the city’s principal beauties, «nonnulla antiqua et visu digna».

Aria possessed a rare gift - the ability to communicate with the ancient spirits that dwelled in the heart of the Enchanted Forest. Her emerald-green eyes sparkled with the wisdom of the ages, and her long, flowing hair shimmered like moonlight. Eldoria was a realm of balance, where light and darkness coexisted in harmony. However, an ominous shadow had begun to creep across the land, threatening to disrupt the delicate equilibrium. Aria sensed the growing unrest among the spirits and knew that she was destined to play a crucial role in restoring the balance. Guided by a vision, Aria set out on a quest to seek the Oracle of Whispers, a mystical being who resided atop the Silver Peak, the tallest mountain in Eldoria. Legends spoke of the Oracle's ability to unveil the secrets of the past, present, and future. Aria hoped that the Oracle would provide her with the knowledge needed to confront the encroaching darkness. As she ventured deeper into the Enchanted Forest, Aria encountered magical creatures who became her steadfast companions. There was Luna, a graceful unicorn with a silvery mane that glowed with ethereal light, and Ember, a mischievous fire sprite who danced around Aria, leaving trails of warmth and light in her wake."

Among these pilots was Flight Lieutenant James, a skilled and courageous flyer known for his daring maneuvers and quick thinking. One day, during an intense aerial combat, James found himself outnumbered by several enemy Messerschmitt fighters. Despite being in a dire situation, he remained calm and focused. With exceptional skill, he maneuvered his Spitfire through the chaotic sky, evading enemy fire and weaving through the clouds. As the dogfight ensued, James noticed one of his fellow pilots, Flight Officer Carter, in trouble. Carter's aircraft was heavily damaged and was losing altitude rapidly. Realizing the imminent danger, James immediately broke away from his engagement with the enemy and dove towards Carter's stricken plane. With precision flying, James positioned his Spitfire underneath Carter's failing aircraft. Braving the enemy fire, he signaled to Carter to bail out while he attempted to stabilize the damaged plane. Carter, albeit shaken, managed to eject safely moments before his aircraft plummeted to the ground and exploded. James, now alone and vastly outnumbered, skillfully fought off the pursuing German fighters, using every ounce of his flying expertise to outmaneuver and evade them. Despite the odds, he managed to evade the enemy long enough to make a daring escape back to the safety of his airbase. His selfless act of risking his own safety to save a fellow pilot and his exceptional aerial skills in the face of overwhelming odds became a legend among his squadron. Flight Lieutenant James' bravery and quick thinking not only saved a comrade but also showcased the unwavering courage displayed by many RAF pilots during the critical moments of World War II."

A few hundred metres offshore, one of the fishermen, a veteran of decades of nights on the dark water, laid his paddles across the boat and prepared a line. He tied two flat black stones above a baited hook, then let the fine filament slip through his fingers until it touched the seabed, deep below.

But this time the tug was unfamiliar, and the old fisherman fought with the line before he managed to pull the fish to the surface. Deep water at night is ink-black and the first thing he saw was a pair of eyes, glowing pink in the pale moonlight. As they surfaced, he could make out a large fish. He recognised it instantly as a gombessa, or coelacanth (pronounced see-la-kanth). Although rarely caught, it was known to all in the Comoros as their most precious asset, a fish that some said was the ancestor of man. Only six coelacanths had been caught in the waters off Hahaya since 1966, and none in the previous five years, but the old fisherman knew what to do.
