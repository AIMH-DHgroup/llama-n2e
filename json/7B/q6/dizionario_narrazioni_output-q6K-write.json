            "0": "Event 1:\nMany monsters appear in old sea stories. Among the others, the Aspidochelone (or Fastitocalon), a creature similar to an island; the bishop-fish (also known as the sea bishop, sea monk or monk-fish), a sea monster whose legend might also have originated from encounters with seals, sharks or walruses; and, even the biblical Leviathan.\n\nEvent 2:\nMyth around these creatures has lived at least up to mid 1800 and is still alive in some cultures.\n\nEvent 3:\nThe Greek philosopher Aristotle (fourth century BC), in his work \"The history of animals\", distinguished the common squid (teuthis) from its larger and rarer cousin (teuthus or, in some translations, teuthos), which could reach 2.3m in length.\n\nEvent 4:\nRoman naturalist Pliny the Elder (first century AD), in his work \"Natural history\", described a giant squid, which had a body “as large as a barrel” and tentacles reaching 9.1m in length.\n\nEvent 5:\nCuriously, In Pliny’s (as well as in Aristotle’s) works, the giant squid was treated as a common animal and did not belong to myths of their ages.\n\nEvent 6:\nHowever, some later authors, especially in fictional literature, made this mistake.\n\nEvent 7:\nIn fact, the Kraken’s legend originated from sailors’ accounts dating from a millennium after the age of Pliny.\n\nEvent 8:\nThe legend of the Kraken was born from seamen’s stories, but it was much modified and strengthened over the years.\n\nEvent 9:\nRight from the start, the Kraken was universally incorporated into Nordic mythology and folklore.\n\nEvent 10:\nAccording to an obscure, ancient manuscript of circa 1180 by King Sverre of Norway, the Kraken was just one of many sea monsters. Still, it had its own peculiarities: it was colossal in size, as large as an island, and capable of sinking ships; it haunted the seas between Norway and Iceland, and between Iceland and Greenland."

According to the edition of Leonardi Bruni Aretini Epistolarum libri VIII, I (pp. 102-109), published in Florence in 1741, Bruni traveled with the entourage of curials on behalf of Pope John XXIII.\n\nEvent 2:\nBruni and his companions headed to Constance to attend the Council, which aimed to reestablish the unity of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches and end the Western Schism. According to Bruni's letter (IV 3), he arrived in Verona on November 27th (\"Veronam ad V Kalendas Decembris cum satis mane venissem\") and stayed there for two days, admiring some of the city's principal beauties (\"nonnulla antiqua et visu digna\").\n\nEvent 3:\nBruni's transalpine journey to Constance began from Verona."

            "0": "Here are the events of the narrative, written exactly as they appear in the text:\n\n1. During the Battle of Britain in 1940, a squadron of Royal Air Force (RAF) pilots, stationed in England, engaged in relentless dogfights against the Luftwaffe, the German air force.\n2. Among these pilots was Flight Lieutenant James, a skilled and courageous flyer known for his daring maneuvers and quick thinking.\n3. One day, during an intense aerial combat, James found himself outnumbered by several enemy Messerschmitt fighters.\n4. Despite being in a dire situation, he remained calm and focused.\n5. With exceptional skill, he maneuvered his Spitfire through the chaotic sky, evading enemy fire and weaving through the clouds.\n6. As the dogfight ensued, James noticed one of his fellow pilots, Flight Officer Carter, in trouble.\n7. Carter's aircraft was heavily damaged and was losing altitude rapidly.\n8. Realizing the imminent danger, James immediately broke away from his engagement with the enemy and dove towards Carter's stricken plane.\n9. With precision flying, James positioned his Spitfire underneath Carter's failing aircraft.\n10. Braving the enemy fire, he signaled to Carter to bail out while he attempted to stabilize the damaged plane.\n11. Carter, albeit shaken, managed to eject safely moments before his aircraft plummeted to the ground and exploded.\n12. James, now alone and vastly outnumbered, skillfully fought off the pursuing German fighters, using every ounce of his flying expertise to outmaneuver and evade them.\n13. Despite the odds, he managed to evade the enemy long enough to make a daring escape back to the safety of his airbase.\n14. His selfless act of risking his own safety to save a fellow pilot and his exceptional aerial skills in the face of overwhelming odds became a legend among his squadron.\n15. Flight Lieutenant James' bravery and quick thinking not only saved a comrade but also showcased the unwavering courage displayed by many RAF pilots during the critical moments of World War II."
