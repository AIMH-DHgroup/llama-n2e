        "bruni": "The Florentine humanist and chancellor Leonardo Bruni (Arezzo, 1370 - Florence, March 9, 1444) recounts the journey to Constance he made between November and December 1414 in a letter from his private epistolary (IV 3 according to the edition edited by Lorenzo Mehus, Leonardi Bruni Aretini Epistolarum libri VIII, I, Florentiae, ex typographia Bernardi Paperinii, 1741, pp. 102-109).\nBruni, who in those years held the post of apostolic secretary on behalf of Pope John XXIII, headed to the German city along with the entourage of curials in the pontiff's service to attend the work of the Council, which met in Constance to reestablish the unity of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches and thus end the Western Schism.\nIn order to reach Pope John XXIII, who made his entrance in Constance as early as October 28, Bruni had to move from Rome with the other members of the Curia a few weeks later, for in the letter he states that he arrived in Verona on November 27 («Veronam ad V Kalendas Decembris cum satis mane venissem») and stayed there for two days, during which he had the opportunity to admire some of the city’s principal beauties, «nonnulla antiqua et visu digna».\nBruni’s transalpine journey to Constance begins from this city.",

        "expensiveCities": "In news that won’t come as a surprise to anyone who’s been feeling the pinch, the global cost of living crisis is far from over.\nAccording to the annual Worldwide Cost of Living Index that’s published by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the average cost of living rose by 7.4% this year. Grocery prices increased the fastest.\nAlthough this is slightly lower than the 8.1% jump the same survey recorded in 2022, the numbers remain significantly higher than “historic trends.”\nHowever, utility prices, the fastest rising category in the 2022 survey, showed the least amount of inflation this time around.\nPrice increases are slowing in pace because of the waning of supply chain issues since China lifted its Covid-19 restrictions in late 2022.\nBut grocery prices are continuing to rise as retailers pass on higher costs to consumers.\n“We expect inflation to continue to decelerate in 2024, as the lagged impact of interest-rate rises starts affecting economic activity, and in turn, consumer demand,” Upasana Dutt, Head of Worldwide Cost of Living at EIU, said in a statement.\nDutt went on to warn the upside risks of armed conflict and extreme weather remain.\n“Further escalations of the Israel-Hamas war would drive up energy prices, while a greater than expected impact from El Niño would push up food prices even further,” she added.\nInevitably, increasing living costs have meant that many cities have become more expensive to live in – but some get hit harder than others.\nThe city-state of Singapore and Switzerland’s Zurich were named as the most expensive cities in the world.\nThe rise of the latter, which jumped from sixth place on last year’s list, was attributed to the strength of the Swiss Franc along with the high prices of groceries, household goods and recreation.\nSingapore’s costly transport and clothing were also noted.",
        "latin": "In a picturesque village nestled amid rolling hills, there lived a wise old scholar named Lucius. Lucius, known for his erudition, spent his days immersed in ancient texts, seeking wisdom from the past to illuminate the present.\nOne day, as he strolled through the quaint cobblestone streets, he stumbled upon a mysterious tome in an antiquarian bookstore. The title, \"Lux et Veritas,\" whispered promises of enlightenment and truth. Intrigued, Lucius opened the book to find a Latin inscription that read, \"Sapientia est potentia,\" reminding him that knowledge is power.\nEager to unravel the secrets within, he delved into the pages, each filled with arcane knowledge and cryptic symbols. As Lucius continued his exploration, he came across a passage that struck a chord deep within him: \"Tempus fugit.\" The reminder that time flies resonated with him, urging him to make the most of every moment.\nInspired, he decided to embark on a journey to share his newfound wisdom with the villagers. In the heart of the village square, Lucius gathered the townsfolk and began to impart his insights. With eloquence, he quoted Seneca, saying, \"Non scholae sed vitae discimus,\" emphasizing that we learn not for school but for life.\nThe villagers listened attentively as Lucius wove the wisdom of the ancients into the fabric of their everyday lives. As seasons changed and years passed, Lucius became a revered figure in the village, guiding generations with the timeless words of Cicero: \"Salus populi suprema lex esto,\" let the welfare of the people be the supreme law.\nThe village flourished under Lucius's tutelage, and his teachings echoed through the ages. On the eve of his 80th birthday, Lucius gathered the villagers one last time. With a twinkle in his eye, he shared a final Latin aphorism: \"Vivere est vincere,\" to live is to conquer. Lucius, having conquered the limitations of time, bid farewell to the mortal realm, leaving behind a legacy steeped in Latin wisdom that would endure for centuries."
