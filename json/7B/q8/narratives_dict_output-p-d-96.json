According to the annual Worldwide Cost of Living Index published by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the average cost of living rose by 7.4% this year.\n\nGrocery prices increased the fastest, although this is slightly lower than the 8.1% jump recorded in 2022. However, grocery prices are continuing to rise as retailers pass on higher costs to consumers.\n\n“We expect inflation to continue to decelerate in 2024, as the lagged impact of interest-rate rises starts affecting economic activity, and in turn, consumer demand,” Upasana Dutt, Head of Worldwide Cost of Living at EIU, said in a statement.\n\nDutt went on to warn that the upside risks of armed conflict and extreme weather remain. “Further escalations of the Israel-Hamas war would drive up energy prices, while a greater than expected impact from El Niño would push up food prices even further,” she added.\n\nInevitably, increasing living costs have meant that many cities have become more expensive to live in – but some get hit harder than others. The city-state of Singapore and Switzerland’s Zurich were named as the most expensive cities in the world.\n\nThe rise of Zurich, which jumped from sixth place on last year’s list, was attributed to the strength of the Swiss Franc along with the high prices of groceries, household goods, and recreation. Singapore’s costly transport and clothing were also noted."

            "0": "\nHere is the text divided into paragraphs:\n\nIn a picturesque village nestled amid rolling hills, there lived a wise old scholar named Lucius. Lucius, known for his erudition, spent his days immersed in ancient texts, seeking wisdom from the past to illuminate the present.\n\nOne day, as he strolled through the quaint cobblestone streets, he stumbled upon a mysterious tome in an antiquarian bookstore. The title, \"Lux et Veritas,\" whispered promises of enlightenment and truth. Intrigued, Lucius opened the book to find a Latin inscription that read, \"Sapientia est potentia,\" reminding him that knowledge is power.\n\nEager to unravel the secrets within, he delved into the pages, each filled with arcane knowledge and cryptic symbols. As Lucius continued his exploration, he came across a passage that struck a chord deep within him: \"Tempus fugit.\" The reminder that time flies resonated with him, urging him to make the most of every moment.\n\nInspired, he decided to embark on a journey to share his newfound wisdom with the villagers. In the heart of the village square, Lucius gathered the townsfolk and began to impart his insights. With eloquence, he quoted Seneca, saying, \"Non scholae sed vitae discimus,\" emphasizing that we learn not for school but for life.\n\nThe villagers listened attentively as Lucius wove the wisdom of the ancients into the fabric of their everyday lives. As seasons changed and years passed, Lucius became a revered figure in the village, guiding generations with the timeless words of Cicero: \"Salus populi suprema lex esto,\" let the welfare of the people be the supreme law.\n\nThe village flourished under Lucius's tutelage, and his teachings echoed through the ages. On the eve of his 80th birthday, Lucius gathered the villagers one last time. With a twinkle in his eye, he shared a final Latin aphorism: \"Vivere est vincere,\" to live is to conquer. Lucius, having conquered the limitations of time, bid farewell to the mortal realm, leaving behind a legacy steeped in Latin wisdom that would endure for centuries."
