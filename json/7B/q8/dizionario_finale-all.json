        "calamaro": "Here is the text divided into paragraphs:\n\nMany monsters appear in old sea stories. Among the others, the Aspidochelone (or Fastitocalon), a creature similar to an island; the bishop-fish (also known as the sea bishop, sea monk or monk-fish), a sea monster whose legend might also have originated from encounters with seals, sharks or walruses; and, even the biblical Leviathan.\n\nMyth around these creatures has lived at least up to mid 1800 and is still alive in some cultures. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (fourth century BC), in his work \"The history of animals\", distinguished the common squid (teuthis) from its larger and rarer cousin (teuthus or, in some translations, teuthos), which could reach 2.3m in length.\n\nRoman naturalist Pliny the Elder (first century AD), in his work \"Natural history\", described a giant squid, which had a body “as large as a barrel” and tentacles reaching 9.1m in length. Curiously, In Pliny’s (as well as in Aristotle’s) works, the giant squid was treated as a common animal and did not belong to myths of their ages.\n\nHowever, some later authors, especially in fictional literature, made this mistake. In fact, the Kraken’s legend originated from sailors’ accounts dating from a millennium after the age of Pliny. The legend of the Kraken was born from seamen’s stories, but it was much modified and strengthened over the years.\n\nRight from the start, the Kraken was universally incorporated into Nordic mythology and folklore. According to an obscure, ancient manuscript of circa 1180 by King Sverre of Norway, the Kraken was just one of many sea monsters. Still, it had its own peculiarities: it was colossal in size, as large as an island, and capable of sinking ships; it haunted the seas between Norway and Iceland, and between Iceland and Greenland.",

He tied two flat black stones above a baited hook, then let the fine filament slip through his fingers until it touched the seabed, deep below.\n\nHe was waiting for the nibble and tug of a fish—a snapper or a grouper, perhaps, or if he was lucky, a marlin, which he would take the next morning to sell at the market in Moroni.\n\nBut this time the tug was unfamiliar, and the old fisherman fought with the line before he managed to pull the fish to the surface.\n\nDeep water at night is ink-black and the first thing he saw was a pair of eyes, glowing pink in the pale moonlight. As they surfaced, he could make out a large fish. He recognised it instantly as a gombessa, or coelacanth (pronounced see-la-kanth).\n\nAlthough rarely caught, it was known to all in the Comoros as their most precious asset, a fish that some said was the ancestor of man. Only six coelacanths had been caught in the waters off Hahaya since 1966, and none in the previous five years, but the old fisherman knew what to do.\n\nHe tethered it to the back of the boat and paddled back to the village. He knew there was little time to lose as gombessa live in the ocean depths and had never survived for more than a few hours at the surface. Determined to try, he made a safe water pool, and waited for the sun to rise.",

Grocery prices increased the fastest.\n\nAlthough this is slightly lower than the 8.1% jump the same survey recorded in 2022, the numbers remain significantly higher than “historic trends.”\n\nHowever, utility prices, the fastest rising category in the 2022 survey, showed the least amount of inflation this time around.\n\nPrice increases are slowing in pace because of the waning of supply chain issues since China lifted its Covid-19 restrictions in late 2022.\n\nBut grocery prices are continuing to rise as retailers pass on higher costs to consumers.\n\n“We expect inflation to continue to decelerate in 2024, as the lagged impact of interest-rate rises starts affecting economic activity, and in turn, consumer demand,” Upasana Dutt, Head of Worldwide Cost of Living at EIU, said in a statement.\n\nDutt went on to warn the upside risks of armed conflict and extreme weather remain.\n\n“Further escalations of the Israel-Hamas war would drive up energy prices, while a greater than expected impact from El Niño would push up food prices even further,” she added.\n\nInevitably, increasing living costs have meant that many cities have become more expensive to live in – but some get hit harder than others.\n\nThe city-state of Singapore and Switzerland’s Zurich were named as the most expensive cities in the world.\n\nThe rise of the latter, which jumped from sixth place on last year’s list, was attributed to the strength of the Swiss Franc along with the high prices of groceries, household goods and recreation.\n\nSingapore’s costly transport and clothing were also noted.",

They track sea ice extent, which is defined as the total area of the ocean in which the ice cover fraction is at least 15%.\n\nBetween March and September 2023, the ice cover in the Arctic shrank from a peak area of 5.64 million square miles (14.62 million square kilometers) to 1.63 million square miles (4.23 million square kilometers). That’s roughly 770,000 square miles (1.99 million square kilometers) below the 1981–2010 average minimum of 2.4 million square miles (6.22 million square kilometers).\n\nThe amount of sea ice lost was enough to cover the entire continental United States.\n\nSea ice around Antarctica reached its lowest winter maximum extent on Sept. 10, 2023, at 6.5 million square miles (16.96 million square kilometers). That’s 398,000 square miles (1.03 million square kilometers) below the previous record-low reached in 1986 – a difference that equates to roughly the size of Texas and California combined.\n\nThe average maximum extent between 1981 and 2010 was 7.22 million square miles (18.71 million square kilometers). “It’s a record-smashing sea ice low in the Antarctic,” said Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at NSIDC. “Sea ice growth appears low around nearly the whole continent as opposed to any one region.”",

Raised by her mother, Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke, Ada showed an early aptitude for mathematics. Her education in mathematics and science was guided by tutors such as Mary Somerville and Augustus De Morgan.\n\nAda's remarkable analytical skills and curiosity soon led her to the work of Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor. In her annotated translation of an article about Babbage's Analytical Engine, Ada introduced notes that extended far beyond mere translation. These notes, which some consider to be the first computer program, detailed how the Analytical Engine could manipulate symbols beyond numbers, including music and art.\n\nAda's visionary ideas laid the foundation for modern programming. \"La máquina de Babbage no es simplemente una calculadora gigante, sino una herramienta capaz de crear arte y música mediante el manejo de símbolos abstractos\", she wrote, emphasizing the potential artistic applications of Babbage's invention. Her insights extended beyond the technical realm, with Ada contemplating the broader societal implications of computing.\n\nIn a letter to her friend Charles Wheatstone, she articulated, \"Les machines de Babbage pourraient un jour influencer profondément la société, modifiant la façon dont nous pensons et travaillons.\" (Babbage's machines could one day profoundly influence society, altering how we think and work.)\n\nAda Lovelace's tragically short life ended in 1852 at the age of 36.
