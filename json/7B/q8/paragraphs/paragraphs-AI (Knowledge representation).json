An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. Knowledge bases need to represent things such as: objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; situations, events, states, and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\",\n        \"Among the most difficult problems in KR are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \\\"facts\\\" or \\\"statements\\\" that they could express verbally).\",\n        \"Knowledge acquisition is the difficult problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. Modern AI gathers knowledge by \\\"scraping\\\" the internet (including Wikipedia).
