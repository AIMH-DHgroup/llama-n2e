"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"On 15 December 2023, a 32-year-old father and his two-month-old daughter in a stroller were shot dead in Kl\\u00e1novice Forest on the eastern outskirts of Prague. The police conducted a detailed search of the entire forest with hundreds of officers, while a special task force was set up in order to find the perpetrator.\",\n        \"On 20 December, police said that they had no leads in the case but were continuing to search for the perpetrator. The firearms website zbrojnice.com noted a similarity of the case with the 2005 \\\"Forest Killer\\\" murders, in which a former police officer killed three random victims in forests in preparation for a planned mass murder in the Prague Metro, which was prevented by his early arrest; the article ended with an appeal to readers to remain vigilant and carry their concealed firearms.\",\n        \"Five hours after the attack at Charles University, the police released information that they had found evidence in David Koz\\u00e1k's house linking him to the Kl\\u00e1novice Forest murders. At a press conference on 22 December, the chief detective of Prague's 1st General Crime Unit stated that Koz\\u00e1k had been one of about 4,000 suspects in the Kl\\u00e1novice Forest case. However, because he lived in the Central Bohemian Region, they were a few days short of being able to prevent the shootings.\",\n        \"Later that day, the police confirmed that a firearm found at Koz\\u00e1k's house had been ballistically matched with the bullets used in the Kl\\u00e1novice Forest murders. On 21 December 2023 at 12:20 CET, the Central Bohemian Police were alerted by Koz\\u00e1k's mother, who said she had received a message from a friend that her son was planning to take his own life and that he was en route from his hometown of Hostou\\u0148 to Prague. At 12:45, the police found the body of Koz\\u00e1k's father in his home.\"\n    ]\n}"
