"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"Although the term domain did not come into use until the mid-18th century, the concept can be traced back to the ancient Roman law. The Romans had a large proprietary rights system where they defined \\\"many things that cannot be privately owned\\\" as res nullius, res communes, res publicae and res universitatis.\",\n        \"When looking at it from a historical perspective, one could say the construction of the idea of \\\"public domain\\\" sprouted from the concepts of res communes, res publicae, and res universitatis in early Roman law.\",\n        \"When the first early copyright law was originally established in Britain with the Statute of Anne in 1710, public domain did not appear. However, similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the 18th century. Instead of \\\"public domain\\\", they used terms such as publici juris or propri\\u00e9t\\u00e9 publique to describe works that were not covered by copyright law.\",\n        \"The phrase \\\"fall in the public domain\\\" can be traced to mid-19th-century France to describe the end of copyright term. The French poet Alfred de Vigny equated the expiration of copyright with a work falling \\\"into the sink hole of public domain\\\".\",\n        \"If the public domain receives any attention from intellectual property lawyers it is still treated as little more than that which is left when intellectual property rights, such as copyright, patents, and trademarks, expire or are abandoned. In this historical context Paul Torremans describes copyright as a, \\\"little coral reef of private right jutting up from the ocean of the public domain.\\\"\",\n        \"Copyright law differs by country, and the American legal scholar Pamela Samuelson has described the public domain as being \\\"different sizes at different times in different countries\\\".\"\n    ]\n}"
