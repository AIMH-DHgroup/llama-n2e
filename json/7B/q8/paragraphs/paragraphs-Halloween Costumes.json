A Scottish term, the tradition is called \\\"guising\\\" because of the disguises or costumes worn by the children. In Ireland and Scotland, the masks are known as 'false faces', a term recorded in Ayr, Scotland in 1890 by a Scot describing guisers: \\\"I had mind it was Halloween . . . the wee callans (boys) were at it already, rinning aboot wi\\u2019 their fause-faces (false faces) on and their bits o\\u2019 turnip lanthrons (lanterns) in their haun (hand)\\\".\",\n        \"Costuming became popular for Halloween parties in the US in the early 20th century, as often for adults as for children, and when trick-or-treating was becoming popular in Canada and the US in the 1920s and 1930s.\",\n        \"Eddie J. Smith, in his book Halloween, Hallowed is Thy Name, offers a religious perspective to the wearing of costumes on All Hallows' Eve, suggesting that by dressing up as creatures \\\"who at one time caused us to fear and tremble\\\", people are able to poke fun at Satan \\\"whose kingdom has been plundered by our Saviour\\\".\",\n        \"Images of skeletons and the dead are traditional decorations used as memento mori.\",\n        \"\\\"Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF\\\" is a fundraising program to support UNICEF, a United Nations Programme that provides humanitarian aid to children in developing countries.
