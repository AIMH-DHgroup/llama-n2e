"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"The 1999 D\\u00fczce earthquake occurred on 12 November at 18:57:22 local time with a moment magnitude of 7.2 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent), causing damage and at least 845 fatalities in D\\u00fczce, Turkey.\",\n        \"The epicenter was approximately 100 km (62 mi) to the east of the extremely destructive 1999 \\u0130zmit earthquake that happened nearly three months earlier. Both strike-slip earthquakes were caused by movement on the North Anatolian Fault.\",\n        \"The western and central parts of Turkey lie on the eastern part of the Anatolian Plate, which is currently being forced to the west by the continuing northward movement of the Arabian Plate. In northern Turkey, this westward motion is taken up by a major zone of dextral (right-lateral) strike-slip, the North Anatolian Fault.\",\n        \"The 1999 D\\u00fczce event is the most recent in a sequence of large earthquakes that have affected the North Anatolian Fault, starting towards the eastern end with the 1939 Erzincan earthquake, then propagating towards the west with events in 1942, 1943, 1944, 1951, 1957, 1967 and finally the 1999 \\u0130zmit event. At its western end the North Anatolian Fault splits into two main segments, with the northern of these giving rise to the 1999 earthquakes.\",\n        \"The earthquake had an estimated magnitude in the range 7.1\\u20137.2 on the moment magnitude scale. The International Seismological Centre gives a magnitude of 7.16\\u00b10.1 for this event in their catalogue. The maximum measured intensity was IX at a seismometer about 4 km from the epicentre, with a peak ground acceleration of 147.80%g and a peak ground velocity of 113.02 cm/sec.\",\n        \"D\\u00fczce and surrounding areas had already been quite badly affected by the \\u0130zmit earthquake a few months earlier, so that many buildings were already in a weakened state when the November earthquake struck. The number of fatalities in D\\u00fczce is recorded as 478, with an additional 313 in the town of Kayna\\u015fl\\u0131 and 48 in the city of Bolu. A significant number of deaths were attributed to the presence of traditional heaters causing fires and related smoke effects, particularly in Kayna\\u015fl\\u0131.\"\n    ]\n}"
