His first novel, The Castle of Argol, is dedicated to that surrealist writer, to whom he devoted a whole book in 1948.\",\n        \"In 1936, he joined the French Communist Party but quit the party in 1939 after the Molotov\\u2013Ribbentrop Pact was signed. During the Second World War, he was a prisoner of war in Silesia with other officers of the French Army. One of the friendships he formed there was with author and literary critic Armand Hoog, who later described Gracq as a passionate individualist and ferociously anti-Vichy.\",\n        \"In 1950, he published a fierce attack on contemporary literary culture and literary prizes in the review Emp\\u00e9docle titled La Litt\\u00e9rature \\u00e0 l'estomac.
