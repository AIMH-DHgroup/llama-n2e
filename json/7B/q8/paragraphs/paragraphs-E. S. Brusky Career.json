It became the first doctor's office in Green Bay that was not located in the downtown area.\",\n        \"Brusky worked his entire medical career at the West Side Clinic, where he practiced a broad range of medicine that included delivering babies, orthopedics and surgery, before retiring in 1987.\",\n        \"During his career, he worked with the local Catholic diocese to move and re-establish St. Mary's Hospital in Green Bay.\",\n        \"In 1962, Brusky was hired by the Green Bay Packers to be the team physician. He was hired after another doctor, Mason LeTellier, gave a recommendation to Packers head coach Vince Lombardi while they were golfing.\",\n        \"Lombardi noted to LeTellier that his players were seeing numerous doctors, who all had differing opinions regarding injuries and ailments. LeTellier told Lombardi to talk with Brusky, who Lombardi had golfed with before at the Oneida Golf and Riding Club.\",\n        \"Lombardi met with Brusky the next day and hired him, although for almost ten years the position was unpaid, with Brusky only being reimbursed for expenses. Brusky set-up his own office, which included an x-ray machine.\",\n        \"Brusky continued in this role for 29 years before retiring in 1990 as the longest tenured team physician in the NFL.

Don Majkowski, the Packers' quarterback, suffered a shoulder injury in a game during the 1990 NFL season. Brusky cleared Majkowski to play, however when Majkowski attempted to throw the ball he said he was in too much pain to play.\",\n        \"Brusky made public comments saying that Majkowski was clear to play, however after a second opinion, a tear was found in Majkowski's rotator cuff and he had surgery and was out for the rest of the season.\"\n    ]\n}"
