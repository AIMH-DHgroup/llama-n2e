His father, Mart\\u00edn Cort\\u00e9s de Monroy, born in 1449 to Rodrigo or Ruy Fern\\u00e1ndez de Monroy and his wife Mar\\u00eda Cort\\u00e9s, was an infantry captain of distinguished ancestry but slender means.\",\n        \"Hern\\u00e1n's mother was Catal\\u00edna Pizarro Altamirano. Through his mother, Hern\\u00e1n was second cousin once removed of Francisco Pizarro, who later conquered the Inca Empire of modern-day Peru, and not to be confused with another Francisco Pizarro, who joined Cort\\u00e9s to conquer the Aztecs. (His maternal grandmother, Leonor S\\u00e1nchez Pizarro Altamirano, was first cousin of Pizarro's father Gonzalo Pizarro y Rodriguez.)\",\n        \"Through his father, Hern\\u00e1n was related to Nicol\\u00e1s de Ovando, the third governor of Hispaniola. His paternal great-grandfather was Rodrigo de Monroy y Almaraz, 5th Lord of Monroy. According to his biographer and chaplain, Francisco L\\u00f3pez de G\\u00f3mara, Cort\\u00e9s was pale and sickly as a child.\",\n        \"At the age of 14, he was sent to study Latin under an uncle in Salamanca. Later historians have misconstrued this personal tutoring as time enrolled at the University of Salamanca. After two years, Cort\\u00e9s returned home to Medell\\u00edn, much to the irritation of his parents, who had hoped to see him equipped for a profitable legal career.\",\n        \"However, those two years in Salamanca, plus his long period of training and experience as a notary, first in Valladolid and later in Hispaniola, gave him knowledge of the legal codes of Castile that he applied to help justify his unauthorized conquest of Mexico. At this point in his life, Cort\\u00e9s was described by G\\u00f3mara as ruthless, haughty, and mischievous. The 16-year-old youth had returned home to feel constrained life in his small provincial town.\",\n        \"By this time, news of the exciting discoveries of Christopher Columbus in the New World was streaming back to Spain.\"\n    ]\n}"
