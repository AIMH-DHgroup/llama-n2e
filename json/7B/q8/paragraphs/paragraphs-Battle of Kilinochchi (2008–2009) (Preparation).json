The town of Kilinochchi was a major target for the troops during this offensive.\",\n        \"With the SLA advancing on several fronts, the 57 Division and Task Force 1 (now 58 Division) operated on the Kilinochchi front with the objective of capturing the town. The overall operation was led by Maj Gen. Jagath Jayasuriya, the Wanni Security Forces Commander.\",\n        \"Both divisions advanced from the west of the country, with 57 Division approaching Kilinochchi from the south and west while Task Force 1 advanced further northwards, capturing other key LTTE strongholds in order to converge on Kilinochchi from the north.\",\n        \"By early October, Kilinochchi had been vacated by its residents and units of the Kilinochchi hospital, banks and several government institutions were relocated at Tharmapuram, a village 13 kilometres (8 mi) away. 57 Division, led by Maj. Gen. Jagath Dias, captured Akkarayankulam on 18 October 2008, a large village located to the southwest of Kilinochchi. The capture of this village enabled the SLA to attack Kilinochchi from the south.\",\n        \"The Iranamadu junction, located to the south of Kilinochchi, was captured later, enabling the SLA to advance towards Kilinochchi from the south.

Shavendra Silva, advanced along the western coast, capturing several strategically important locations including the Mannar \\\"Rice Bowl\\\" area, Viddathalthivu, and Nachchikuda. Task Force 1 launched an attack on Pooneryn on 15 November 2008, spearheaded by troops from the 2nd and 3rd Commando Regiments and a squadron of Special Forces, and captured the area. From there, Task Force 1 moved west and captured Paranthan on 31 December 2008, enabling the SLA to attack Kilinochchi from the north.\",\n        \"The LTTE used their self-styled \\\"Ditch-cum-bund\\\" strategy to defend the town and constructed earth bunds and trenches around the area in an \\\"L\\\" shape to halt the advance of the Sri Lankan military.
