"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"Marie-Henri Baille was born in Grenoble, Is\\u00e8re, on 23 January 1783, into the family of the advocate and landowner Ch\\u00e9rubin Beyle and his wife Henriette Gagnon.\",\n        \"He was an unhappy child, disliking his \\\"unimaginative\\\" father and mourning his mother, whom he loved fervently, and who died in childbirth in 1790, when he was seven.\",\n        \"He spent \\\"the happiest years of his life\\\" at the Beyle country house in Claix near Grenoble. His closest friend was his younger sister, Pauline, with whom he maintained a steady correspondence throughout the first decade of the 19th century.\",\n        \"His family was part of the bourgeois class of the Ancien Regime, which explains his ambiguous attitude toward Napoleon, the Bourbon Restoration, and the monarchy later on.\",\n        \"The military and theatrical worlds of the First French Empire were a revelation to Beyle. He was named an auditor with the Conseil d'\\u00c9tat on 3 August 1810, and thereafter took part in the French administration and in the Napoleonic wars in Italy.\",\n        \"He travelled extensively in Germany and was part of Napoleon's army in the 1812 invasion of Russia. Upon arriving, Stendhal witnessed the burning of Moscow from just outside the city as well as the army's winter retreat.\",\n        \"He was appointed Commissioner of War Supplies and sent to Smolensk to prepare provisions for the returning army. He crossed the Berezina River by finding a usable ford rather than the overwhelmed pontoon bridge, which probably saved his life and those of his companions.\",\n        \"He arrived in Paris in 1813, largely unaware of the general fiasco that the retreat had become. Stendhal became known, during the Russian campaign, for keeping his wits about him, and maintaining his \\\"sang-froid and clear-headedness.\\\"\",\n        \"He also maintained his daily routine, shaving each day during the retreat from Moscow.\",\n        \"After the 1814 Treaty of Fontainebleau, he left for Italy, where he settled in Milan. In 1830, he was appointed as French consul at Trieste and Civitavecchia. He formed a particular attachment to Italy, where he spent much of the remainder of his career.\"\n    ]\n}"
