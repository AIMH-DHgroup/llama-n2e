"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"The earliest surviving text of a Robin Hood ballad is the 15th-century \\\"Robin Hood and the Monk\\\". This is preserved in Cambridge University manuscript Ff.5.48. Written after 1450, it contains many of the elements still associated with the legend, from the Nottingham setting to the bitter enmity between Robin and the local sheriff.\",\n        \"The first printed version is A Gest of Robyn Hode (c. 1500), a collection of separate stories that attempts to unite the episodes into a single continuous narrative.\",\n        \"After this comes \\\"Robin Hood and the Potter\\\", contained in a manuscript of c. 1503. \\\"The Potter\\\" is markedly different in tone from \\\"The Monk\\\": whereas the earlier tale is \\\"a thriller\\\" the latter is more comic, its plot involving trickery and cunning rather than straightforward force.\",\n        \"Other early texts are dramatic pieces, the earliest being the fragmentary Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham (c. 1475). These are particularly noteworthy as they show Robin's integration into May Day rituals towards the end of the Middle Ages; Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham, among other points of interest, contains the earliest reference to Friar Tuck.\",\n        \"The plots of neither \\\"the Monk\\\" nor \\\"the Potter\\\" are included in the Gest; and neither is the plot of \\\"Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne\\\", which is probably at least as old as those two ballads although preserved in a more recent copy. Each of these three ballads survived in a single copy, so it is unclear how much of the medieval legend has survived, and what has survived may not be typical of the medieval legend. It has been argued that the fact that the surviving ballads were preserved in written form in itself makes it unlikely they were typical; in particular, stories with an interest for the gentry were by this view more likely to be preserved.\"\n    ]\n}"
