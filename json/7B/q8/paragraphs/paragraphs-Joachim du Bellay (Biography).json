"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"Joachim du Bellay was born at the Castle of La Turmeli\\u00e8re, not far from Lir\\u00e9, near Angers, being the son of Jean du Bellay, Lord of Gonnor, first cousin of the cardinal Jean du Bellay and of Guillaume du Bellay. His mother was Ren\\u00e9e Chabot, daughter of Perceval Chabot and heiress of La Turmeli\\u00e8re.\",\n        \"Both his parents died while he was still a child, and he was left to the guardianship of his elder brother, Ren\\u00e9 du Bellay, who neglected his education, leaving him to run wild at La Turmeli\\u00e8re.\",\n        \"When he was twenty-three, however, he received permission to study law at the University of Poitiers, no doubt with a view to his obtaining preferment through his kinsman the Cardinal Jean du Bellay. At Poitiers he came in contact with the humanist Marc Antoine Muret, and with Jean Salmon Macrin (1490\\u20131557), a Latin poet famous in his day. There too he probably met Jacques Peletier du Mans, who had published a translation of the Ars Poetica of Horace, with a preface in which much of the program advocated later by La Pl\\u00e9iade is to be found in outline.\",\n        \"It was probably in 1547 that du Bellay met Ronsard in an inn on the way to Poitiers, an event which may justly be regarded as the starting-point of the French school of Renaissance poetry. The two had much in common, and became fast friends. While Ronsard and Jean-Antoine de Ba\\u00eff were most influenced by Greek models, du Bellay was more especially a Latinist, and perhaps his preference for a language so nearly connected with his own had some part in determining the more national and familiar note of his poetry.\",\n        \"In 1548 appeared the Art po\\u00e9tique of Thomas S\\u00e9billet, who enunciated many of the ideas that Ronsard and his followers had at heart, though with essential differences in the point of view, since he held up as models Cl\\u00e9ment Marot and his disciples.\"\n    ]\n}"
