"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"As the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, Badlam enlisted in the Continental Army. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the New York City artillery under General Henry Lee, and was over the following year promoted to first lieutenant and captain.\",\n        \"While stationed in New York, he became acquainted with Alexander Hamilton, and was appreciated for his engineering abilities. He reportedly was well-liked by George Washington, who would serve as a political inspiration for Badlam throughout his life.\",\n        \"He was appointed to major and transferred to service as an artillery commander under General Richard Montgomery in his invasion of Quebec, sailing north along the Hudson River. Following the invasion's failure, he returned to Fort Crown Point.\",\n        \"On July 4, 1776, he captured a fortified Vermont hill near Ticonderoga, and on July 18 named it Mount Independence, a name later confirmed by General Horatio Gates. There, he had helped and directed the building of fortifications in the region.\",\n        \"During his service, he met the Marquis de Lafayette, who granted Badlam a sword. After fighting at Fort Stanwix under Colonel Marinus Willett in August 1777, Badlam fell under a serious fever. Gravely ill and unable to serve military duties, physicians considered his recovery unlikely, and he resigned service to return to Dorchester.\",\n        \"While ill, he reported to have undergone an intense religious experience and prayed for his recovery. Badlam recovered from his illness soon after returning to Dorchester with his wife Mary. Shortly afterwards, Badlam had his first daughter, Polly.\",\n        \"Continuing in his career as a surveyor, he plotted Dorchester and neighboring towns. By 1780, he had become a very well-respected cabinet artisan, with a workshop on Old Plymouth Road (now River St.) in the Lower Mills. He frequently collaborated with other artisans and cabinetmakers, frequently doing turning for others. As well as cabinetry, he built and sold picture frames, chairs, windows, looking-glasses, and advertised skills in molding and gilding. Badlam's apprentices included Abiel White and Abner Hersey.\"\n    ]\n}"
