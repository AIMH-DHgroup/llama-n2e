"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"The Roman Empire was one of the largest in history, with contiguous territories throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The Latin phrase imperium sine fine (\\\"empire without end\\\") expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire. In Virgil's Aeneid, limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by Jupiter. This claim of universal dominion was renewed when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century.\",\n        \"In addition to annexing large regions, the Romans directly altered their geography, for example cutting down entire forests. Roman expansion was mostly accomplished under the Republic, though parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century, when Roman control in Europe, Africa, and Asia was strengthened.\",\n        \"Under Augustus, a \\\"global map of the known world\\\" was displayed for the first time in public at Rome, coinciding with the creation of the most comprehensive political geography that survives from antiquity, the Geography of Strabo. When Augustus died, the account of his achievements (Res Gestae) prominently featured the geographical cataloguing of the Empire.\",\n        \"Geography alongside meticulous written records were central concerns of Roman Imperial administration. The Empire reached its largest expanse under Trajan (r.\\u200998\\u2013117), encompassing 5 million square kilometres. The traditional population estimate of 55\\u201360 million inhabitants accounted for between one-sixth and one-fourth of the world's total population and made it the most populous unified political entity in the West until the mid-19th century.\",\n        \"Recent demographic studies have argued for a population peak from 70 million to more than 100 million. Each of the three largest cities in the Empire \\u2013 Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch \\u2013 was almost twice the size of any European city at the beginning of the 17th century.\",\n        \"Trajan's successor Hadrian adopted a policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines) were marked, and the frontiers (limites) patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable.\"\n    ]\n}"
