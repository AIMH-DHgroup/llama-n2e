"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"The newly formed Moon settled into a much closer Earth orbit than it has today. Each body therefore appeared much larger in the sky of the other, eclipses were more frequent, and tidal effects were stronger.\",\n        \"Due to tidal acceleration, the Moon's orbit around Earth has become significantly larger, with a longer period. Following formation, the Moon has cooled and most of its atmosphere has been stripped.\",\n        \"The lunar surface has since been shaped by large impact events and many small ones, forming a landscape featuring craters of all ages.\",\n        \"The Moon was volcanically active until 1.2 billion years ago, which laid down the prominent lunar maria. Most of the mare basalts erupted during the Imbrian period, 3.3\\u20133.7 billion years ago, though some are as young as 1.2 billion years and some as old as 4.2 billion years.\",\n        \"There are differing explanations for the eruption of mare basalts, particularly their uneven occurrence which mainly appear on the near-side. Causes of the distribution of the lunar highlands on the far side are also not well understood.\",\n        \"Topological measurements show the near side crust is thinner than the far side. One possible scenario then is that large impacts on the near side may have made it easier for lava to flow onto the surface.\"\n    ]\n}"
