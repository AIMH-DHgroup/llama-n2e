"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"Le Corricolo, published in English as Sketches of Naples, is a work by Alexandre Dumas published in 1843. In it, he recalls the trip he made from Rome to Naples in 1835 with the painter Louis Godefroy Jadin.\",\n        \"The original idea of Dumas was a trip along the coast of the whole Mediterranean, which should have given him material for a travel book. In order to do that, in 1834 he launched several subscriptions, but he was unable to raise the entire sum needed for the trip.\",\n        \"So, he had to reduce the scope of his trip to southern Italy, and it is likely that Dumas had tried to get in touch with revolutionary and Mazzinian elements in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, with a view to an anti-Bourbon uprising.\",\n        \"On 12 May 1835 he left together with his friend Louis Godefroy Jadin, a painter, Jadin's dog, Milord, his mistress and later wife, Ida Ferrier, and her sister. Passing through Toulon, Nice, Genoa, Livorno, Pisa and Florence (where he arrived on 1 July) he reached Rome, where he asked Ferdinand II's ambassador for permission to visit the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\",\n        \"Unfortunately, he had been denounced as a republican agitator and was banned from visiting the kingdom. Due to that, he traveled to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies using the name of Joseph Guichard, a painter and resident of the French Academy at Villa Medici. He traveled clandestinely, always accompanied by his friends, and, after reaching Naples, where he left his lover, he embarked for Sicily on a small boat and was joined by the contralto Caroline Ungher, who became his lover during the trip.\",\n        \"He returned to Naples at the end of October 1835 and found Ida, but he was forced to leave the city on 23 November, after only three weeks, after being denounced. Dumas had to wait ten years for the final draft of the romance, time which allowed him to search for literary sources to make the work richer.\"\n    ]\n}"
