"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"Koalas are asocial animals and spend just 15 minutes a day on social behaviors.\",\n        \"Where there are more koalas and fewer trees, home ranges are smaller and more clumped while the reverse is true for areas with fewer animals and more trees. Koala society appears to consist of \\\"residents\\\" and \\\"transients\\\", the former being mostly adult females and the latter males. Resident males appear to be territorial and dominant. The territories of dominant males are found near breeding females, while younger males must wait until they reach full size to challenge for breeding rights. Adult males occasionally venture outside their home ranges; when they do so, dominant ones retain their status.\",\n        \"As a male climbs a new tree, he rubs his chest against it and sometimes dribbles urine. This scent-marking behavior probably serves as communication, and individuals are known to sniff the bottom of a newly found tree. Chest gland secretions are complex chemical mixtures \\u2014 about 40 compounds were identified in one analysis \\u2014 that vary in composition and concentration with the season and the age of the individual. Adult males communicate with loud bellows \\u2014 \\\"a long series of deep, snoring inhalations and belching exhalations\\\". Because of their low frequency, these bellows can travel far through the forest. Koalas may bellow at any time of the year, particularly during the breeding season, when it serves to attract females and possibly intimidate other males. They also bellow to advertise their presence to their neighbors when they climb a different tree. These sounds signal the male's actual body size, as well as exaggerate it; females pay more attention to bellows that originate from larger males.\",\n        \"Female koalas bellow, though more softly, in addition to making snarls, wails, and screams. These calls are produced when in distress and when making defensive threats. Squeaking and sqawking are produced when distraught; the former is made by younger animals and the latter by older ones. When another individual climbs over it, a koala makes a low closed-mouth grunt. Koalas also communicate with facial expressions.\"\n    ]\n}"
