English was adopted in parts of North America, parts of Africa, Oceania, and many other regions.\",\n        \"When they obtained political independence, some of the newly independent states that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.\",\n        \"In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC and other broadcasters, caused the language to spread across the planet much faster.\",\n        \"In the 21st century, English is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.\",\n        \"As Modern English developed, explicit norms for standard usage were published, and spread through official media such as public education and state-sponsored publications.\",\n        \"In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language, which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms.\",\n        \"In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent of the British standard.\",\n        \"Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.\",\n        \"In modern English, the loss of grammatical case is almost complete (it is now only found in pronouns, such as he and him, she and her, who and whom), and SVO word order is mostly fixed.
