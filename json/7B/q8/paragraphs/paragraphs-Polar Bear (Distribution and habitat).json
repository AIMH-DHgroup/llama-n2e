"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"Polar bears inhabit the Arctic and adjacent areas. Their range includes Greenland, Canada, Alaska, Russia and the Svalbard Archipelago of Norway. Polar bears have been recorded 25 km (16 mi) from the North Pole.\",\n        \"The southern limits of their range include James Bay and Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada and St. Matthew Island and the Pribilof Islands of Alaska. They are not permanent residents of Iceland but have been recorded visiting there if they can reach it via sea ice.\",\n        \"Due to minimal human encroachment on the bears' remote habitat, they can still be found in much of their original range, more so than any other large land carnivore. Polar bears have been divided into at least 18 subpopulations labelled East Greenland, Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, Chukchi Sea, northern and southern Beaufort Sea, Viscount Melville, M'Clintock Channel, Gulf of Boothia, Lancaster Sound, Norwegian Bay, Kane Basin, Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, Foxe Basin and the western and southern Hudson Bay populations.\",\n        \"Bears in and around the Queen Elizabeth Islands have been proposed as a subpopulation but this is not universally accepted. A 2022 study has suggested that the bears in southeast Greenland should be considered a different subpopulation based on their geographic isolation and genetics.\",\n        \"Polar bear populations can also be divided into four gene clusters: Southern Canadian, Canadian Archipelago, Western Basin (northwestern Canada west to the Russian Far East) and Eastern Basin (Greenland east to Siberia).\",\n        \"The polar bear is dependent enough on the ocean to be considered a marine mammal. It is pagophilic and mainly inhabits annual sea ice covering continental shelves and between islands of archipelagos. These areas, known as the \\\"Arctic Ring of Life\\\", have high biological productivity.\",\n        \"The species tends to frequent areas where sea ice meets water, such as polynyas and leads, to hunt the seals that make up most of its diet. Polar bears travel in response to changes in ice cover throughout the year. They are forced onto land in summer when the sea ice disappears.\",\n        \"Terrestrial habitats used by polar bears include forests, mountains, rocky areas, lakeshores and creeks.\"\n    ]\n}"
