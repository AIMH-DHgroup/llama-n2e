"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"Many monsters appear in old sea stories. Among the others, the Aspidochelone (or Fastitocalon), a creature similar to an island; the bishop-fish (also known as the sea bishop, sea monk or monk-fish), a sea monster whose legend might also have originated from encounters with seals, sharks or walruses; and, even the biblical Leviathan.\",\n        \"Myth around these creatures has lived at least up to mid 1800 and is still alive in some cultures. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (fourth century BC), in his work \\\"The history of animals\\\", distinguished the common squid (teuthis) from its larger and rarer cousin (teuthus or, in some translations, teuthos), which could reach 2.3m in length.\",\n        \"Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (first century AD), in his work \\\"Natural history\\\", described a giant squid, which had a body \\u201cas large as a barrel\\u201d and tentacles reaching 9.1m in length. Curiously, In Pliny\\u2019s (as well as in Aristotle\\u2019s) works, the giant squid was treated as a common animal and did not belong to myths of their ages.\",\n        \"However, some later authors, especially in fictional literature, made this mistake. In fact, the Kraken\\u2019s legend originated from sailors\\u2019 accounts dating from a millennium after the age of Pliny. The legend of the Kraken was born from seamen\\u2019s stories, but it was much modified and strengthened over the years.\",\n        \"Right from the start, the Kraken was universally incorporated into Nordic mythology and folklore. According to an obscure, ancient manuscript of circa 1180 by King Sverre of Norway, the Kraken was just one of many sea monsters. Still, it had its own peculiarities: it was colossal in size, as large as an island, and capable of sinking ships; it haunted the seas between Norway and Iceland, and between Iceland and Greenland.\"\n    ]\n}"
