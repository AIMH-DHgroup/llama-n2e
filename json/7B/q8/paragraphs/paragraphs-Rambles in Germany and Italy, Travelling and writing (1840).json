"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"Mary Shelley and her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley had lived in Italy from 1818 to 1822. Although Percy Shelley and two of their four children died there, Italy became for Mary Shelley \\\"a country which memory painted as paradise\\\", as she put it.\",\n        \"The couple's Italian years were a time of intense intellectual and creative activity. Percy composed a series of major poems, and Mary wrote the autobiographical novel Matilda, the historical novel Valperga, and the plays Proserpine and Midas.\",\n        \"Mary Shelley had always wanted to return to Italy and she excitedly planned her 1840 trip. In June 1840, Mary Shelley, Percy Florence (her one surviving child), and a few of his friends\\u2014George Defell, Julian Robinson, and Robert Leslie Ellis\\u2014began their European tour.\",\n        \"They travelled to Paris and then to Metz. From there, they went down the Moselle by boat to Coblenz and then up the Rhine to Mainz, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Baden-Baden, Freiburg, Schaffhausen, Z\\u00fcrich, the Spl\\u00fcgen, and Chiavenna. Feeling ill, Shelley rested at a spa in Baden-Baden; she had wracking pains in her head and \\\"convulsive shudders\\\", symptoms of the meningioma that would eventually kill her.\",\n        \"This stop dismayed Percy Florence and his friends, as it provided no entertainment for them; moreover, since none of them spoke German, the group was forced to remain together. After crossing Switzerland by carriage and railway, the group spent two months at Lake Como, where Mary relaxed and reminisced about how she and Percy had almost rented a villa with Lord Byron at the lake one summer.\",\n        \"The group then travelled on to Milan, and from there, Percy Florence and his friends soon left for Cambridge to take their university finals. Mary Shelley remained, waiting for funds to complete her journey. In September, she returned to England via Geneva and Paris. Upon her return, she became depressed and could not write: \\\"[in Italy] I might live \\u2013 as once I lived\\u2014hoping\\u2014loving\\u2014aspiring enjoying ... I am placid now, & the days go by \\u2013 I am happy in Percy [Florence's] society & health \\u2013 but no adjuncts\\\".\"\n    ]\n}"
