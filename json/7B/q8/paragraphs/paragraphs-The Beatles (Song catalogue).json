"{\n    \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"In March 1969, James arranged to sell his and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company Associated Television (ATV), founded by impresario Lew Grade, without first informing the Beatles.\",\n        \"The band then made a bid to gain a controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding. The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, \\\"I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in the City.\\\"\",\n        \"By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon\\u2013McCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973. In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969.\",\n        \"In 1981, financial losses by ATV's parent company, Associated Communications Corporation (ACC), led it to attempt to sell its music division. According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry, Grade contacted McCartney, offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $30 million.\",\n        \"According to an account McCartney gave in 1995, he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue if Grade were ever willing to \\\"separate off\\\" that portion of ATV Music. Soon afterwards, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for \\u00a320 million, giving the ex-Beatle \\\"a week or so\\\" to decide.\",\n        \"By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a \\u00a35 million bid that was rejected. According to reports at the time, Grade refused to separate Northern Songs and turned down an offer of \\u00a321\\u201325 million from McCartney and Ono for Northern Songs.\",\n        \"In 1982, ACC was acquired in a takeover by Australian business magnate Robert Holmes \\u00e0 Court for \\u00a360 million.\",\n        \"In 1985, Michael Jackson purchased ATV for a reported $47.5 million. The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights.\"\n    ]\n}"
